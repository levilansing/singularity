  <strong>180 predictions. 180 countdown timers. One existential question.</strong>

## Why

Everyone with a social handle and a GPU has an opinion about when AGI/superintelligence/the singularity will arrive. Rather than argue about it, I figured: why not put *all* the predictions in one place with a countdown so we can watch them be wrong together?

This is a collection of 180 predictions from researchers, CEOs, survey panels, and the occasional philosopher — each with its own countdown, source links, and enough context to understand what they're actually claiming (and why you should be skeptical).

DISCLAIMER: Nearly every line of code and every bit of research was generated by AI with some human oversight.

## What It Does

- Countdown timers that flip like old airport departure boards, because the apocalypse deserves good UX
- 180 predictions spanning AGI, superintelligence, the technological singularity, and the intelligence explosion
- Color-coded by urgency: already wrong, uncomfortably soon, safely far off, and "heat death of the universe"
- Interactive timeline showing every prediction on a single axis so you can really feel the disagreement
- Concept explainers for terms like "the singularity" and "recursive self-improvement" so you can sound smart at parties
- Random prediction on each visit, because the future should be surprising
