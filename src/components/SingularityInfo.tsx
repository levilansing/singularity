          The <strong>technological singularity</strong> is the hypothetical future point where technological
          growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for human
          civilization. Usually it involves AI becoming smarter than us and then making itself even smarter,
          recursively, until we're basically housepets.

          The term was popularized by mathematician John von Neumann in the 1950s and later by Vernor Vinge and

          They've been consistently wrong, but they keep trying. We respect the hustle.
