{"tldr_summary":"While 1,000+ researchers signed an open letter calling for a six-month AI development pause, Eliezer Yudkowsky publicly refused to sign it—not because he opposed slowing down, but because he thought it asked for far too little. The MIRI co-founder argues that building superintelligent AI under current circumstances means 'literally everyone on Earth will die,' comparing humanity's odds to 'a 10-year-old playing chess against Stockfish 15' or 'Australopithecus fighting Homo sapiens.' His prescription? An immediate, indefinite, worldwide shutdown of all frontier AI development, enforced by international treaty with military consequences for violations. Yudkowsky's position represents the most extreme end of AI safety concerns: that alignment is so difficult and the stakes so absolute that the only rational response is complete cessation. His critics note this stance offers no path forward in a world where competitive pressures make coordination nearly impossible.","criteria_definition":"Superintelligent AI that doesn't care about humans and can outmaneuver all attempts at containment","confidence_level":"Expects literal extinction as 'the obvious thing that would happen' - not remote possibility but default outcome without precision alignment breakthroughs","source_name":"TIME magazine / Various 2024","source_url":"https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/","concept_keys":["superintelligence","alignment"]}
