{"tldr_summary":"Sam Altman's January 2025 prediction that 'AI agents join the workforce' in 2025 represented peak optimism about autonomous AI systems. The vision: agents that work independently for days, managing complex workflows without human intervention, fundamentally changing how companies operate. By year-end, the reality was more nuanced—some narrow agent deployments showed promise, but the transformative 'coworker' scenario remained aspirational. Altman's blog posts about Sora and other products emphasized 'high rate of change' and learning from deployment, suggesting an iterative approach rather than sudden transformation. The agent vision includes booking travel, managing emails, conducting research, and executing multi-step business processes autonomously. But integration challenges, reliability issues, and trust barriers slowed adoption beyond pilot programs. Whether agents 'materially changed' company output in 2025 depends heavily on how you define 'material'—some productivity gains in narrow domains versus wholesale workforce transformation. The prediction captures OpenAI's strategic positioning around agents as the next major product category after chatbots, while the hedged language ('may see') provided escape hatches if reality fell short of vision.","criteria_definition":"AI agents materially joining workforces in 2025 with measurable impact on company output and productivity","confidence_level":"Moderate confidence with expectation of rapid iteration and learning from deployment","source_name":"OpenAI blog posts","source_url":"https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections","concept_keys":["transformative-ai"]}
