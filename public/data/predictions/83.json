{"tldr_summary":"Three years after predicting AGI by 2025, Elon Musk recalibrated to 2028-2029 for 'digital superintelligence'—AI that's smarter than any human at everything, not just narrow domains. The revision came as Musk was building xAI and assembling one of the world's largest GPU clusters for training Grok, his answer to ChatGPT. Unlike his 2020 prediction made in relative isolation, this timeline emerged from direct involvement in frontier AI development, giving it more grounding in actual technical constraints around compute, data, and algorithmic progress. The 5-6 year window from 2023 maintains Musk's characteristic aggressive optimism while acknowledging that AGI proved harder than his 2020 self expected. Critics note this follows Musk's standard playbook: make bold prediction, miss deadline, revise timeline forward while maintaining aggressive stance, continue building toward the goal anyway. The difference? This time he's putting tens of billions of dollars behind it through xAI, suggesting he's betting his capital alongside his credibility.","criteria_definition":"Digital superintelligence exceeding the smartest human at every cognitive task","confidence_level":"Confident projection based on observed capability acceleration and compute scaling","source_name":"Twitter/X Spaces discussion (July 2023)","source_url":"https://www.diamandis.com/blog/age-of-abundance-30-human-level-ai","concept_keys":["superintelligence","scaling-hypothesis","industry-academia-divergence"]}
