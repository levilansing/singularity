{"tldr_summary":"Connor Leahy founded Conjecture specifically to work on AI alignment under the operating assumption that AGI arrives before 2035, with 50-50 odds by 2030. This isn't abstract forecasting - his company's entire business model and hiring pitch assumes we have less than a decade to solve alignment before superintelligent systems emerge. That level of urgency either indicates access to information suggesting rapid capability gains or selection bias where people who think AGI is imminent self-select into AI safety startups. Probably both. Leahy's timeline drives the race to AGI safety mentality: if we're this close, incremental research won't cut it - we need breakthroughs now. His aggressive forecast positions Conjecture in the maximally alarming camp alongside Kokotajlo and others who left frontier labs concerned about pace versus safety. When someone stakes their career and company on AGI arriving within years, they're either remarkably informed or remarkably committed to a belief. The scary part is we'll find out which pretty soon.","criteria_definition":"AGI arrival with alignment unsolved; all Conjecture employees expected AGI before 2035","confidence_level":"50% by 2030; entire company operates under assumption","source_name":"YouTube and Conjecture blog","source_url":"https://sifted.eu/articles/connor-leahy-ai-alignment","concept_keys":["agi","alignment"]}
