{"tldr_summary":"Thomas Nagel's legendary 1974 essay 'What Is It Like to Be a Bat?' accidentally became one of the most important thought experiments for AI consciousness. The philosopher argued that subjective experience—the 'what it's like' quality of consciousness—can't be reduced to physical processes we can observe from the outside. You can study a bat's echolocation neurology all day, but you'll never know what it's like to BE a bat experiencing echolocation. This creates an awkward problem for AGI enthusiasts: if we can't even verify consciousness in biological systems besides ourselves, how would we know if we've created it in silicon? Nagel's work suggests that consciousness and subjective experience might be fundamentally different from computational processes, meaning true superintelligence (if it requires consciousness) could be much further away than tech optimists think. His philosophical skepticism doesn't provide specific timelines—it questions whether the entire project is conceptually coherent. While AI labs race toward AGI, Nagel's bat quietly asks: 'But will your system actually experience anything, or just process information really well?'","criteria_definition":"Superintelligence requiring subjective experience and consciousness, not merely computational power","confidence_level":"Philosophical skepticism about whether consciousness and subjective experience can be computationally replicated at all","source_name":"Philosophy of mind","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nagel","concept_keys":["superintelligence"]}
