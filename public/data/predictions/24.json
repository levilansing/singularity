{"tldr_summary":"David Roodman modeled gross world product growth rates over millennia and found the curve approaching infinity around 2037 - an economic singularity where automation drives hyperbolic GDP growth. His method treats AGI as inevitable once you fit historical growth curves, though critics note he's fitting a straight line to a very wiggly function that includes the Black Death, the Industrial Revolution, and everything in between. The model says: if growth trends continue accelerating as they have for 10,000 years, we hit a vertical asymptote around 2037 when AI automates the economy fast enough to create a feedback loop. This is either brilliant macroeconomic forecasting or the most elaborate curve-fitting exercise in futurism. Roodman's approach sidesteps AI architecture debates entirely - he doesn't care about transformers or neural scaling laws, just whether economic growth hits the infinity point. The framework predicts economic transformation without taking a position on consciousness, alignment, or whether LLMs are the right path. It's forecasting by looking at the output (GDP) rather than the mechanism (AI capabilities), which is refreshingly different from counting parameters and extrapolating.","criteria_definition":"Economic singularity: GWP growth approaching infinity implies transformative AI around 2037","confidence_level":"Model-based estimate from GWP extrapolation","source_name":"GWP extrapolation model - LessWrong","source_url":"https://coefficientgiving.org/research/modeling-the-human-trajectory/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","accelerating-change","scaling-hypothesis","economic-singularity","alignment"]}
