{"tldr_summary":"While competitors race to declare AGI timelines, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella threw cold water on the entire enterprise, warning of a \"Winner's Curse\" for companies obsessing over AGI milestones. In a January 2025 interview, Nadella argued the industry's fixation on achieving artificial general intelligence is a distraction from actually making useful products. He suggested AGI could be 5-20 years away but emphasized that pinning down exact dates misses the point entirely. This is classic Microsoft strategy: let OpenAI and Google burn resources chasing moonshots while Microsoft focuses on selling AI tools to enterprises today. Nadella's refusal to play the timeline game is either wisdom or clever positioning—probably both. His message to AI companies: stop measuring yourselves by arbitrary milestones and start measuring by whether anyone actually pays for your product.","criteria_definition":"Rejects AGI as meaningful milestone; emphasizes incremental practical utility over general intelligence threshold","confidence_level":"Explicitly dismissive of AGI milestone fixation; focuses on practical utility over theoretical thresholds","source_name":"Multiple 2025 interviews","source_url":"https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-thoughts-on-agi-winners-curse","concept_keys":["agi"]}
