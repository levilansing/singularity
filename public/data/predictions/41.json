{"tldr_summary":"Ray Kurzweil's 652-page manifesto doubles down on his signature prediction: 2045 marks the Singularity, when machine intelligence becomes infinitely more powerful than all human intelligence combined. The kicker? Humans merge with AI via nanobots connecting our brains to the cloud, multiplying our intelligence a millionfold. Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns—exponential growth in computing, genetics, nanotech, and robotics—underpins everything. His previous predictions have been eerily accurate (he called the internet's rise, mobile computing, and AI beating humans at chess), so when he promises immortality through technological transcendence, Silicon Valley listens. The book became a bestseller and cemented 2045 as the date every futurist loves to cite. Whether it's prophetic or wishful thinking, we're now close enough to his AGI milestone (2029) to start keeping score.","criteria_definition":"The point where machine intelligence becomes infinitely more powerful than all human intelligence combined and humans merge with machines.","confidence_level":"High confidence based on Law of Accelerating Returns and decades of exponential trend analysis","source_name":"The Singularity Is Near (2005)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near","concept_keys":["event-horizon","accelerating-change","industry-academia-divergence"]}
