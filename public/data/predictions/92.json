{"tldr_summary":"Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford economist who's spent years listening to AI hype, says 2026 will be the year we stop arguing and start measuring. The prediction isn't about AGI or superintelligence—it's about something almost more radical: actual data on whether AI helps or hurts the economy. Brynjolfsson envisions 'AI economic dashboards' replacing the endless think pieces and conference panels where everyone shouts past each other. It's a refreshingly pragmatic take in a field drowning in speculation. The subtext? We've been deploying AI at scale for years now, and somehow still don't have good numbers on productivity, employment effects, or GDP impact. 2026 is when the receipts supposedly arrive, and everyone's going to have to confront whether their pet theories hold up against reality.","criteria_definition":"Year when AI's economic impact transitions from speculation to measurable data via economic dashboards","confidence_level":"Moderate confidence based on need for rigorous economic measurement frameworks","source_name":"Stanford AI experts 2026 predictions","source_url":"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/stanford-ai-experts-predict-what-will-happen-in-2026","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis","economic-singularity"]}
