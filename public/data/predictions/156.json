{"tldr_summary":"In a December 2024 Reddit AMA, Sam Altman predicted AGI arrives by 2029 and will 'whoosh by' with 'surprisingly little' societal change—a deliberate counter to doomsday narratives. The framing positions AGI as a gradual transition rather than a discontinuous rupture, which conveniently aligns with OpenAI's commercial interests in normalizing increasingly capable AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei offered a similar 2026-2027 timeline, creating a competitive dynamic where AI lab leaders race to claim the earliest plausible AGI date. Altman's prediction relies on OpenAI's specific AGI definition: systems outperforming humans at 'most economically valuable work'—a bar that sidesteps harder questions about consciousness, understanding, or general reasoning. The 'whoosh by' language suggests AGI will be less dramatic than expected, possibly because we're already living through the transition without recognizing it. Critics argue this framing serves to minimize concerns about unemployment, safety, and concentration of power while maximizing investor enthusiasm. The 5-year timeline (2024-2029) is aggressive but not absurd given current progress, though it assumes no major technical barriers emerge.","criteria_definition":"AGI as systems outperforming humans at most economically valuable work, per OpenAI's official definition","confidence_level":"High confidence with expectation that AGI will 'whoosh by' with surprisingly minimal societal disruption","source_name":"Reddit AMA and interviews (late 2024)","source_url":"https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/sam-altman-claims-agi-will-whoosh-by-in-5-years-with-surprisingly-little-societal-change-while-anthropic-ceo-predicts-a-2026-or-2027-breakthrough-theres-no-ceiling-below-the-level-of-humans-theres-a-lot-of-room-at-the-top-for-ais","concept_keys":["agi","soft-takeoff","economic-singularity","alignment","industry-academia-divergence"]}
