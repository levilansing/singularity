{"tldr_summary":"Louis Rosenberg, an AI researcher, predicted 2030 for the technological singularity as part of Emerj's comprehensive survey of 32 PhD researchers examining when machine intelligence would surpass human capabilities. The survey tackled six major questions about humanity's post-singularity future, from timeline predictions to whether AI would fragment or consolidate into a singleton. Rosenberg's 2030 prediction sits in the near-term optimistic camp, suggesting just over a decade until computers exceed human intelligence with 'profound consequences for society.' The survey represents one of the more systematic attempts to build consensus among credentialed AI researchers about humanity's most consequential technological threshold.","criteria_definition":"Technological singularity where computer intelligence surpasses and exceeds human intelligence with profound societal consequences","confidence_level":"Rosenberg provided a specific year prediction (2030) as part of a comprehensive survey of 32 AI PhD researchers, suggesting medium-high confidence in the timeline","source_name":"Emerj interview 2024","source_url":"https://emerj.com/when-will-we-reach-the-singularity-a-timeline-consensus-from-ai-researchers/","concept_keys":["event-horizon"]}
