{"tldr_summary":"MIT Technology Review's August 2025 report compiled expert forecasts showing dramatic timeline compression—from 80+ years pre-GPT to under 20 years post-ChatGPT. The analysis found 50% probability of early AGI systems by 2028 and full human-surpassing capability across all tasks by 2047. Dario Amodei predicts 'powerful AI' as early as 2026 with Nobel Prize-level intelligence, while Sam Altman sees AGI properties 'coming into view' with 'super-exponential' value creation. The report emphasizes that achieving AGI requires massive infrastructure: 400GW of datacenter power (exceeding total US electricity supply), 200 million chips, and $9 trillion in cumulative investment. The bimodal distribution—near-term weak AGI versus longer-term strong AGI—captures the field's fundamental split on whether we're talking about impressive narrow systems or genuine general intelligence.","criteria_definition":"AI systems achieving several AGI milestones including Nobel Prize-level domain intelligence, multi-interface capability, and autonomous goal-directed reasoning","confidence_level":"Report presents aggregate forecasts with 50% probability markers, indicating measured confidence based on community consensus rather than individual certainty","source_name":"MIT Technology Review - The Road to AGI (August 2025)","source_url":"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MITTR_ArmEBrief_V12_final.pdf","concept_keys":["agi","accelerating-change","survey-drift"]}
