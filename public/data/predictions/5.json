{"tldr_summary":"Posted January 2, 2025 on the EA Forum, Andrew Critch estimated 45% probability of AGI by end of 2026, making him among the most aggressive forecasters in AI safety circles. This timeline appeared in a comprehensive post surveying expert AGI predictions, where Critch's near-term odds stood out even in a field that had dramatically shortened timelines post-ChatGPT. His rationale centers on autoregressive transformers already exhibiting general reasoning capabilities with gains compounding faster than anticipated. The prediction comes from someone working on cooperative AI at UC Berkeley, so this is not uninformed doomerism - this is informed doomerism. His 45% by 2026 implies roughly even odds we have AGI before the next US presidential term ends.","criteria_definition":"AGI broadly defined; assigns 45% probability by end of 2026","confidence_level":"45% by end of 2026","source_name":"X/Twitter post and EA Forum discussion (2024)","source_url":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SYtwChBTs6xkocBSP/when-do-experts-think-human-level-ai-will-be-created","concept_keys":["agi","alignment"]}
