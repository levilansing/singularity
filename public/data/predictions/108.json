{"tldr_summary":"In a field dominated by breathless \"AGI by 2027\" predictions, Stanford HAI co-director James Landay delivered the most boring forecast imaginable: AGI will NOT arrive in 2026. Period. Full stop. No hedging, no \"probably not,\" just a flat negative prediction that makes him the Eeyore of AI forecasting. The prediction appeared in Stanford HAI's annual \"what will happen next year\" roundup, where faculty shifted from AI evangelism to evaluation, emphasizing rigor and transparency over speculative hype. Landay's contribution essentially amounts to \"calm down, everyone\"—a necessary corrective in a discourse where every new benchmark breakthrough triggers \"this is it\" declarations. While others predict economic transformation, existential risk, or human-AI merger, Landay plants his flag on \"not next year, folks.\" It's the prediction equivalent of designated driver: unglamorous, probably correct, and someone had to do it. The fact that explicitly predicting AGI won't arrive in 12 months counts as a notable contrarian position tells you everything about how overheated the discourse has become.","criteria_definition":"Artificial general intelligence will definitively not be achieved in 2026","confidence_level":"High confidence in negative prediction; explicitly states AGI will NOT arrive in 2026","source_name":"Stanford HAI / Stanford experts report","source_url":"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/stanford-ai-experts-predict-what-will-happen-in-2026","concept_keys":["agi","economic-singularity"]}
