{"tldr_summary":"The Polymarket prediction market, where people bet real money on future events, assigns only 15% probability that OpenAI will announce achieving AGI by December 31, 2026. This is fascinatingly lower than most AI insider predictions, suggesting either deep skepticism about OpenAI's AGI definition (will they just declare victory with GPT-5?) or genuine doubt about capability timelines. The market has $24,914 in volume, meaning actual capital is backing these probability estimates. What makes this particularly interesting is that prediction markets often outperform expert polls because participants have skin in the game. The crypto crowd—not exactly known for conservative estimates—thinks Sam Altman's aggressive timeline is mostly bluster. The market structure also reveals a key ambiguity: does this resolve on actual AGI achievement or just OpenAI saying they've achieved it? That definitional slipperiness might explain some of the skepticism.","criteria_definition":"Official announcement from OpenAI or authorized representative claiming AGI achievement","confidence_level":"Market-based probability of 15% for OpenAI AGI announcement by end of 2026, reflecting collective skepticism","source_name":"Polymarket","source_url":"https://polymarket.com/event/openai-announces-it-has-achieved-agi-before-2027","concept_keys":["agi","prediction-markets"]}
