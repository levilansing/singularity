{"tldr_summary":"Economist Robin Hanson analyzes historical economic singularities—the Agricultural Revolution and Industrial Revolution—to predict the next major transition could produce 60-250x economic growth acceleration. His 2008 analysis examines how each previous singularity dramatically increased the rate of economic growth: foraging to farming, farming to industry, and next perhaps industry to something involving AI or brain emulation. The wide range (60-250x) reflects uncertainty about whether the next transition will be more like the smaller agricultural jump or the larger industrial one. Hanson's methodology is refreshingly different from most AI predictions: rather than focusing on technical capabilities, he looks at economic growth patterns and asks what would produce a comparable discontinuity. The timeline (2030-2070) emerges from extrapolating the spacing between previous singularities, which have been accelerating. This framing is valuable because it's agnostic about whether the transition comes from AGI, brain emulation, or some other transformative technology—it simply predicts that something will cause an economic phase change in this century.","criteria_definition":"Economic singularity producing 60-250x growth rate increase comparable to previous revolutionary transitions","confidence_level":"Medium confidence based on pattern matching to previous economic singularities (Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions)","source_name":"Overcoming Bias 2008","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Em","concept_keys":["event-horizon","accelerating-change","economic-singularity"]}
