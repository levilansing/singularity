{"tldr_summary":"Yann LeCun stands as the industry's loudest AGI skeptic, calling current hype complete BS and arguing LLMs fundamentally lack world models and true understanding. As Meta's chief AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, he has the credentials to be contrarian. LeCun proposes Advanced Machine Intelligence instead of AGI, estimates it's decades away, and doubts autoregressive transformers will ever get us there. His vision requires new architectures with self-supervised learning that build internal world models - basically admitting we need to go back to the drawing board. While other Turing Award winners like Hinton and Bengio shortened their timelines to 5-20 years, LeCun dug in his heels at 2035-2060. He's either the only one seeing clearly or the only one missing the exponential curve. His 2045 estimate puts AGI roughly when flying cars were supposed to arrive.","criteria_definition":"AGI requires world models, self-supervised learning, and cognitive architectures that current LLMs lack; proposes Advanced Machine Intelligence instead","confidence_level":"Skeptical of near-term AGI; decades away","source_name":"AI Business and CNBC interviews (2024)","source_url":"https://aibusiness.com/responsible-ai/lecun-debunks-agi-hype-says-it-is-decades-away","concept_keys":["agi","accelerating-change","scaling-hypothesis","industry-academia-divergence"]}
