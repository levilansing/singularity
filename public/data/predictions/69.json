{"tldr_summary":"Dario Amodei just put a countdown timer on every programmer's career. At Davos 2026, the Anthropic CEO declared AI will replace 'all software developers' within 6-12 months and reach 'Nobel-level' scientific research within two years. His prediction: 50% of white-collar jobs vanish within five years. The timeline is breathtakingly aggressive—he's not talking about AI assistance, but full replacement. Amodei's vision of 2027: 'a country of geniuses in a datacenter,' with millions of AI instances operating at superhuman speed across biology, mathematics, engineering, and computer science. His confidence clashed spectacularly with Demis Hassabis and Yann LeCun at the same conference, who argued we're 'nowhere near' AGI and need fundamental breakthroughs. But Amodei isn't backing down—his essay 'Machines of Loving Grace' drips with urgency about racing to build aligned superintelligence before someone builds the unaligned kind. The stakes: either he's right and we're 12 months from the biggest labor market disruption in history, or he's catastrophically wrong and Anthropic's $350B valuation is built on sand. No pressure.","criteria_definition":"Nobel-level scientific research across multiple fields, complete automation of software development, and massive white-collar job displacement","confidence_level":"Extremely high confidence with specific job displacement timelines: 100% of coders in 6-12 months, 50% of white-collar jobs in 5 years","source_name":"World Economic Forum Davos and The Adolescence of Technology essay (January 2026)","source_url":"https://fortune.com/2026/01/23/deepmind-demis-hassabis-anthropic-dario-amodei-yann-lecun-ai-davos/","concept_keys":["superintelligence","economic-singularity","industry-academia-divergence"]}
