{"tldr_summary":"In his 1999 book 'The Age of Spiritual Machines,' Ray Kurzweil made a bold call: by 2029, computers will achieve human-level intelligence and pass the Turing test. His methodology? Track exponential growth in computational power, then estimate when we'd have enough MIPS to simulate a human brain. Twenty-five years later, Kurzweil hasn't budged an inch on this date—through the AI winter, the deep learning revolution, and ChatGPT's arrival. His Law of Accelerating Returns predicts key technological events happen faster as time progresses, with computing power doubling every 12-18 months. The book also predicted nanobots curing cancer, direct neural interfaces, and humans living forever in virtual reality. With 2029 now just years away, we're about to find out if Kurzweil's exponential curves were prophetic genius or mathematical wishful thinking. Either way, his unwavering consistency is either admirable conviction or spectacular stubbornness.","criteria_definition":"Machines with human-level intelligence available from affordable computing devices, passing the Turing test convincingly.","confidence_level":"High confidence based on exponential computing trends and Law of Accelerating Returns, maintained consistently for 25+ years","source_name":"The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Spiritual_Machines","concept_keys":["agi","accelerating-change","turing-test","industry-academia-divergence"]}
