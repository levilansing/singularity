{"tldr_summary":"In a shocking display of intellectual honesty, Daniel Kokotajlo updated his median transformative AI estimate from 2027 to 2029 in August 2025—one of the rare timeline extensions in an era of relentless compression. The former OpenAI governance researcher, who quit over safety concerns and became a prominent voice in AI risk circles, apparently watched recent capability gains and thought 'huh, slower than expected.' His revision suggests the path from GPT-4 to TAI hit more friction than his models predicted. Kokotajlo's range now spans 2027-2035, with 2029 as the median—still aggressive by historical standards, but a notable recalibration from someone whose job was literally predicting this stuff at OpenAI. The 80,000 Hours analysis noted his update as evidence that even accelerationists occasionally pump the brakes when reality underperforms expectations. It's the forecasting equivalent of admitting you were wrong, which in the AI prediction space is about as common as a unicorn riding a Segway. His new timeline still puts TAI within the decade, just with slightly more breathing room for humanity to figure out alignment.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI capable of automating most economically valuable work and accelerating scientific progress","confidence_level":"Medium-high confidence with recent downward revision based on slower-than-expected capability gains","source_name":"80000 Hours review","source_url":"https://80000hours.org/2025/03/when-do-experts-expect-agi-to-arrive/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","accelerating-change","economic-singularity","alignment"]}
