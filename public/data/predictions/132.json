{"tldr_summary":"McKinsey dropped a bombshell in June 2023: generative AI could unlock $2.6 to $4.4 trillion in annual economic value—roughly the size of Germany's entire economy. The consulting giant analyzed 63 specific use cases across customer operations, marketing, software engineering, and R&D, projecting 0.1% to 0.6% annual productivity gains through 2040. Combined with broader automation, they see up to 3.3 percentage points added to productivity growth. But here's the catch: this represents long-term potential, not immediate gains, and requires massive infrastructure investment, workforce retraining, and widespread adoption. Two years later, McKinsey reaffirmed the $4.4 trillion figure in January 2025 while quietly noting that corporate adoption is 'still lagging.' Critics call it the '$4.4 trillion mirage,' arguing McKinsey's rosy projections mask brutal implementation challenges and ignore displacement costs. The estimate sits alongside Goldman Sachs' $7 trillion GDP boost prediction, suggesting Wall Street and consulting firms are singing from the same hymnal—even if reality hasn't caught up.","criteria_definition":"Generative AI achieving $2.6-4.4 trillion in annual economic value across corporate use cases","confidence_level":"High confidence in economic modeling across 63 use cases, 16 business functions, and 47 countries; reaffirmed in January 2025","source_name":"McKinsey AI reports 2025","source_url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/media-center/ai-could-increase-corporate-profits-by-4-trillion-a-year-according-to-new-research","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","economic-singularity"]}
