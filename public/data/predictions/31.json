{"tldr_summary":"Robin Hanson's 2016 book 'The Age of Em' takes the road less traveled: forget AGI, he argues whole brain emulation arrives first, creating a wild 'em economy' where billions of copied human minds work at digital speeds, causing economic doubling times to shrink from years to months to weeks. This em civilization lasts 1-2 subjective years before traditional AI finally supersedes it. The GMU economist's 400-page thought experiment includes labor markets, dating, and architecture in upload society—futurism's most baroque detour from the standard AGI narrative. His timeline puts emulation somewhere between 2035-2100, centered on 2050, making it a distinctly long-game prediction in an era of AI hype cycles measured in months.","criteria_definition":"Whole brain emulation creating an 'em economy' that precedes and differs from traditional AGI","confidence_level":"Detailed economic modeling with specific em society predictions spanning hundreds of pages","source_name":"The Age of Em - Oxford University Press (2016)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity","concept_keys":["event-horizon","economic-singularity","industry-academia-divergence"]}
