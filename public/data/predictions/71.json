{"tldr_summary":"Dario Amodei made a bold March 2025 prediction that AI would write 90% of code within 3-6 months, placing the threshold around mid-2026. Fast forward to February 2026, and Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger declares at Cisco's AI Summit that \"Claude is now writing Claude\" with \"effectively 100%\" AI-generated code at Anthropic. The reality? More complicated. LessWrong analysis suggests the actual figure is \"closer to 90% than 50%\" when including throwaway scripts, but industry-wide adoption sits at 20-40%. The prediction's accuracy depends entirely on how you count—does edited AI code qualify? Do one-off scripts matter? Is human architectural oversight disqualifying? Anthropic may have technically hit their target internally while the rest of the industry lags far behind, making this less a prediction fulfilled and more a definitional shell game about what \"AI-written\" actually means.","criteria_definition":"AI systems autonomously writing 90% of production code with minimal human intervention beyond scaffolding and review","confidence_level":"High confidence with specific 3-6 month timeline, though internal claims suggest threshold already exceeded by February 2026","source_name":"Anthropic conference 2025","source_url":"https://www.financialcontent.com/article/tokenring-2026-1-13-90-of-claudes-code-is-now-ai-written-anthropic-ceo-confirms-historic-shift-in-software-development","concept_keys":["transformative-ai"]}
