{"tldr_summary":"Hans Moravec's 'Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence' painted humans as biological caterpillars destined to build mechanical butterflies. His 2010-2040 timeline (centering on 2030) was based on calculating the brain's computational throughput—about 10 trillion operations per second—then extrapolating when affordable computers would match it. Moravec's vision went beyond simple AGI: he predicted robots would become our 'mind children,' inheriting Earth while humans either merged with machines or faded into obsolescence. His methodology involved tracking computer vision progress (1 MIPS tracks a white line, 10,000 MIPS recognizes 3D objects) and projecting forward. The book explored consciousness uploading, nanotechnology, and space colonization by superintelligent machines. Moravec's timeline proved overly optimistic—we hit his compute benchmarks but not his intelligence milestones, revealing that raw processing power doesn't automatically yield general intelligence. Still, his neuron-counting approach influenced decades of AI forecasting, and his philosophical framework (robots as evolutionary successors rather than tools) shaped transhumanist thinking.","criteria_definition":"Machines matching human-level intelligence across all cognitive domains, enabling a 'postbiological' world where robots become humanity's evolutionary successors.","confidence_level":"High confidence based on hardware extrapolation and neural computational estimates","source_name":"Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence (1988)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec","concept_keys":["agi"]}
