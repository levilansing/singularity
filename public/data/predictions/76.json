{"tldr_summary":"Demis Hassabis has systematically shortened his AGI timeline from \"approximately 10 years\" to \"3-5 years\" as progress accelerates, but consistently emphasizes that scaling alone won't suffice—fundamental breakthroughs remain essential. Speaking at various 2025 events, he specified two critical missing pieces: world models enabling true physics and spatial understanding, plus automated experimentation systems allowing AI to solve fundamental problems through hands-on work (think materials science and fusion research). He predicts agent systems will become \"really impressive and reliable\" within 2-3 years as an intermediate milestone. The kicker: AGI's societal impact will be \"10 times bigger than the Industrial Revolution\" but compressed into a decade rather than a century. Hassabis's evolving timeline reflects genuine learning rather than hype—he's updating based on actual progress while maintaining intellectual honesty about remaining technical barriers. When a Nobel laureate systematically shortens their timeline while simultaneously emphasizing unsolved problems, pay attention to both the acceleration and the caveats.","criteria_definition":"AGI requiring world models enabling physics understanding and automated experimentation systems for hands-on problem solving","confidence_level":"Conditional confidence requiring 1-2 major breakthroughs at AlphaGo/Transformer level, with timeline revised from 10 years to 3-5 years","source_name":"January 2025 interviews","source_url":"https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3646186509667977","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis"]}
