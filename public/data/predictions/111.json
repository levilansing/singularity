{"tldr_summary":"Judea Pearl, the 2011 Turing Award winner who revolutionized AI with Bayesian networks, has a reality check for the AGI optimists: current deep learning is fundamentally insufficient. Pearl argues that today's AI systems are glorified correlation engines that can't understand cause and effect—the bedrock of true intelligence. While everyone obsesses over bigger models and more data, Pearl points out we're missing the actual breakthrough needed: machines that can reason about 'what if' scenarios and understand why things happen, not just that they happen. His timeline of 2050-2100 for AGI isn't pessimism—it's a recognition that we need entirely new architectures that incorporate causal reasoning, something current neural networks simply don't do. The father of modern probabilistic AI is essentially saying his own children aren't enough to birth AGI. That's either humility or a devastating critique of the current approach, depending on whether you're raising venture capital.","criteria_definition":"AGI requires machines that understand causality and counterfactuals, not just pattern matching from correlations.","confidence_level":"High confidence based on fundamental limitations of current AI paradigms lacking causal reasoning capabilities","source_name":"Pearl's work on causality","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl","concept_keys":["agi"]}
