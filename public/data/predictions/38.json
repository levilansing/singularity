{"tldr_summary":"David Chalmers, famous for the 'hard problem of consciousness,' turned his analytical rigor toward the singularity in 2010 and concluded it wasn't just science fiction—recursive self-improvement leading to superintelligence was genuinely plausible. His timeline spans 250 years (2050-2300, centered on 2100), a refreshingly honest admission that we're guessing wildly. Chalmers systematically examined I.J. Good's 1965 intelligence explosion argument and Ray Solomonoff's speed explosion thesis, finding both logically sound if their premises hold. The key insight: even if you assign low probability to near-term singularity, the stakes are so astronomical that preparation matters. A 1% chance of extinction-level AI still demands serious attention. Chalmers' philosophical approach differs from engineering predictions—he's not forecasting when we'll build AGI, but analyzing whether the singularity scenario is conceptually coherent. His answer: yes, it could happen, possibly this century, maybe next, perhaps much later. The 250-year spread isn't wishy-washy hedging; it's intellectual honesty about predicting fundamentally unpredictable phase transitions in intelligence itself.","criteria_definition":"Intelligence explosion via recursive self-improvement leading to superintelligence","confidence_level":"Acknowledges extreme uncertainty with 250-year range, emphasizes plausibility over probability","source_name":"The Singularity: A Philosophical Analysis - Journal of Consciousness Studies (2010)","source_url":"https://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf","concept_keys":["event-horizon","recursive-self-improvement","intelligence-explosion"]}
