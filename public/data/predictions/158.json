{"tldr_summary":"Sam Altman predicted in early 2025 that AI agents would 'join the workforce' and materially change company output, following his October 2024 DevDay declaration that '2025 is when agents will work.' By December 2025, reality delivered a humbling lesson—the language shifted to agents 'beginning to work' on real problems, suggesting slower progress than anticipated. Products like ChatGPT's agent features fell short of autonomous workforce integration, hitting reliability issues, context failures, and trust barriers. The prediction followed a classic hype cycle: bold proclamations in Q4 2024, high expectations in Q1 2025, underwhelming reality through mid-year, and revised messaging by year-end. AI agents are distinct from chatbots in their supposed autonomy—you give them a goal and they execute multi-step workflows independently, potentially for days. But the gap between demo-quality agents and production-ready systems proved larger than expected. The revised 'beginning to work' framing acknowledges early-stage adoption in narrow domains while backing away from transformative claims. It mirrors patterns from self-driving cars ('next year' for a decade) and other transformative technologies that take longer to mature than initial excitement suggests.","criteria_definition":"AI agents capable of autonomous multi-day task execution joining workforces and materially changing company output","confidence_level":"Initially high confidence at DevDay 2024, moderated to 'beginning to work' by December 2025 after reality check","source_name":"OpenAI December 2025 statements","source_url":"https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections","concept_keys":["transformative-ai"]}
