{"tldr_summary":"Andrej Karpathy, the former director of AI at Tesla and founding member of OpenAI, emerged as a prominent voice of caution in October 2025 with his 'decade of agents' thesis. In a Dwarkesh Podcast interview, Karpathy pushed back against industry claims that 2025 would be 'the year of agents,' arguing we're looking at 10-15 years of development before AI agents reliably handle complex real-world tasks. His reasoning cuts through hype: current LLMs excel at text generation but lack persistent memory, robust planning, and genuine reasoning. Karpathy notes he wouldn't trust frontier models alone for basic tasks like calendar prioritization or resume screening without 'substantial customization.' His timeline of 2035-2040 makes him '5-10X more pessimistic than your SF AI house party,' as he puts it. The Tesla AI veteran points to fundamental bottlenecks—reinforcement learning is 'terrible' (though 'everything else is much worse'), model collapse prevents human-like learning, and the problems remain 'tractable but difficult.' Karpathy's sober assessment provides counterweight to CEO promises of AGI by 2027, grounding expectations in actual technical limitations rather than venture capital enthusiasm.","criteria_definition":"AI agents capable of reliably performing complex multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention, requiring breakthroughs in reasoning, planning, and persistent memory","confidence_level":"Moderate confidence based on observed technical bottlenecks, explicitly positioning as '5-10X more pessimistic than your SF AI house party'","source_name":"Dwarkesh podcast October 2025","source_url":"https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy","concept_keys":["agi"]}
