{"tldr_summary":"Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani dropped a bombshell report predicting generative AI could boost global GDP by 7%—nearly $7 trillion—over a decade, with productivity growth jumping 1.5 percentage points. That's roughly adding India and the UK's entire economies combined. The report found two-thirds of jobs face some AI exposure, with up to one-fourth of current work potentially automated. Goldman compared the moment to the electric motor and personal computer revolutions, suggesting a genuine productivity boom rather than mere hype. The irony? By 2025, markets have already priced in $19 trillion in AI company valuations, meaning investors are betting on nearly triple Goldman's most optimistic scenario. The report carefully notes this requires widespread adoption, complementary infrastructure investments, and continued technological progress—all big ifs that Wall Street seems happy to ignore while riding the hype train.","criteria_definition":"Widespread AI adoption driving measurable 7% global GDP increase and 1.5% productivity boost","confidence_level":"High confidence in economic modeling with explicit caveats about adoption requirements and 10+ year timeline","source_name":"Goldman Sachs AI reports","source_url":"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/artificial-intelligence","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","economic-singularity"]}
