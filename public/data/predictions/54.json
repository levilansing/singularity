{"tldr_summary":"In a 1957 speech to the Operations Research Society of America, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell made four audacious predictions published in 1958: within ten years, computers would dominate world chess, prove important mathematical theorems, compose aesthetically valuable music, and replace most psychological theories with computer programs. The duo behind early AI programs like Logic Theorist and General Problem Solver declared with certainty that 'there are now in the world machines that think, that learn, and that create.' Their timeline? By 1968, the range of problems computers could handle would be 'coextensive with the range to which the human mind has been applied.' They were spectacularly wrong on timing—Deep Blue finally beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, 29 years late. Simon would later win the 1978 Nobel Prize in Economics, but his AI predictions became textbook examples of expert overconfidence. Their General Problem Solver turned out far less general than advertised, yet their hubris established the template for AI hype cycles that continues today.","criteria_definition":"Digital computers achieving world chess championship, discovering mathematical theorems, composing accepted music, and psychological theories taking form of computer programs","confidence_level":"Made four specific predictions with 10-year timelines, stating definitively that machines now exist that think, learn, and create","source_name":"Heuristic Problem Solving: The Next Advance in Operations Research (1958)","source_url":"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/04/18/ai-prediction/","concept_keys":["agi","economic-singularity"]}
