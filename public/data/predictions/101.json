{"tldr_summary":"Giancarlo Scoditti's analysis on the EA Forum aggregates multiple expert surveys and individual predictions to conclude AGI is on a \"decade-scale\" timeline—somewhere between 2030 and 2040. This stands in stark contrast to the breathless \"AGI by 2027\" predictions dominating headlines. The compilation includes heavyweights like Yoshua Bengio (5-20 years with 95% confidence), Geoffrey Hinton (5-20 years, lower confidence), and Shane Legg (80% by 2037). AI Impacts' 2023 survey of ML researchers puts median at 2047, while Metaculus forecasters cluster around 2031. The sobering takeaway: when you average out the hype and the skepticism, you get something decidedly less viral—a careful, measured timeline that suggests we have time to get this right, but not unlimited time to waste.","criteria_definition":"Human-level AI across broad task domains, not specialized narrow AI","confidence_level":"No specific confidence stated; represents aggregate expert view suggesting decade-scale timeline rather than imminent arrival","source_name":"AI researcher consensus","source_url":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SYtwChBTs6xkocBSP/when-do-experts-think-human-level-ai-will-be-created","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis"]}
