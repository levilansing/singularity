{"tldr_summary":"Published March 7, 2025 by AAAI Presidential Panel (chaired by Francesca Rossi with 25 AI researchers and 475 survey respondents), this report threw cold water on the scaling hypothesis: 76% of respondents said simply scaling current AI approaches will not yield AGI. The comprehensive 17-chapter report covered the future of AI research across multiple domains, but the AGI finding landed like a bomb in the middle of Silicon Valley's race to pour billions into ever-larger models. The academic consensus: we need fundamentally new approaches, not just bigger GPUs. The report comes as frontier labs bet their entire roadmaps on scaling laws continuing indefinitely.","criteria_definition":"AGI via scaling current approaches; 76% of 475 AI researchers say scaling alone won't yield AGI","confidence_level":"76% of 475 respondents skeptical of scaling approaches","source_name":"AAAI 2025 Presidential Panel Report","source_url":"https://aaai.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AAAI-2025-PresPanel-Report-Digital-3.7.25.pdf","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","survey-drift"]}
