{"tldr_summary":"Launched January 9, 2024 by Matthew Barnett and colleagues at Epoch AI, the Direct Approach Interactive Model lets users play with assumptions about compute scaling, algorithmic progress, and training efficiency to forecast their personal transformative AI timeline. The median lands around 2033 assuming current scaling trends hold, but the model is explicitly adjustable because nobody actually knows the right parameters. Unlike surveys asking experts to guess, this uses neural scaling laws to bound compute needed for a transformative model, then extrapolates forward based on compute trends. It's either rigorous quantitative forecasting or sophisticated garbage-in-garbage-out depending on whether scaling laws continue or hit a wall. The interactive version went live in 2024 after the original Direct Approach paper from 2023, giving everyone a chance to forecast their own singularity.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI via Direct Approach framework: extrapolating training loss trends to predict when models reach transformative capability","confidence_level":"Depends on scaling laws and compute assumptions","source_name":"Epoch AI blog - Direct Approach Interactive Model (Q1 2025)","source_url":"https://epoch.ai/blog/direct-approach-interactive-model","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis"]}
