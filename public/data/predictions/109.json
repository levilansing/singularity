{"tldr_summary":"Jeff Hawkins, the neuroscientist who invented the PalmPilot before pivoting to brain research, runs Numenta with a contrarian thesis: current AI approaches—transformers, LLMs, all of it—won't reach AGI because they're not built like brains. His Thousand Brains Theory proposes intelligence emerges from thousands of cortical columns working in parallel, each building models of the world through sensorimotor learning. While everyone else scales up transformers and crosses fingers, Hawkins argues we need fundamental architectural breakthroughs based on how biological intelligence actually works. His timeline is deliberately vague (2030-2050) because he's predicting paradigm shifts, not incremental scaling. As of January 2025, the Thousand Brains Project spun out as its own nonprofit, releasing open-source code for anyone to experiment with brain-inspired architectures. Hawkins represents the \"we're doing it wrong\" camp—a small but intellectually serious contingent arguing that throwing more compute at current architectures hits fundamental limits. If he's right, all those confident 2027 AGI predictions are building toward a local maximum, not the summit.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI requires fundamentally new brain-inspired computing architectures beyond current deep learning paradigms","confidence_level":"High confidence that current approaches are insufficient; medium confidence in timeline for necessary breakthroughs","source_name":"Numenta research","source_url":"https://www.numenta.com/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis"]}
