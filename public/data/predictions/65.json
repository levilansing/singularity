{"tldr_summary":"Daniel Dennett, the late philosopher who made a career explaining why consciousness is even weirder than you think, was deeply skeptical of near-term AGI timelines. His position: we haven't even figured out how consciousness works in humans, so good luck building it in silicon by 2030. Dennett's work on intentionality, free will, and the 'hard problem' of consciousness suggested AGI requires solving fundamental philosophical puzzles, not just scaling up transformers. He introduced concepts like the 'intentional stance' and 'Cartesian theater' to show how tricky subjective experience really is. Unlike neuroscientist colleagues who think consciousness might emerge from complexity, Dennett argued intelligence and consciousness are deeply intertwined in ways we barely understand. His implicit timeline: maybe 2050-2100, maybe never, depending on whether we're even asking the right questions. The man spent decades arguing consciousness isn't what we think it is, so his AGI skepticism carried philosophical weight. He passed away in 2024 without seeing his questions answered, which kind of proves his point about how hard this stuff is.","criteria_definition":"AGI requires solving hard problem of consciousness and understanding intentionality, not just computational power","confidence_level":"Low confidence in near-term AGI due to unresolved philosophical problems about consciousness and intelligence","source_name":"Philosophy of mind research","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis"]}
