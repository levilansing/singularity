{"tldr_summary":"Published January 22, 2023, Gary Marcus predicts AGI quite possibly before the end of this century, meaning you will be dead first. In conversation with Grady Booch, Marcus characterizes modern LLMs as systems that demonstrably produce bullshit at scale and argues the field wastes resources on an approach that probably is not on the right path. He offered Elon Musk a bet defining AGI as intelligence with resourcefulness and reliability comparable to humans, explicitly ruling out today's LLMs (still no word from Elon). Marcus says we need to pivot to neurosymbolic AI that combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning. Booch notes evolution took 300 million years to develop human cognition and it is never just a matter of software. The article title is sarcastic - Marcus does think AGI will eventually happen, just not via current methods and not in time for anyone's retirement party.","criteria_definition":"Flexible general intelligence with resourcefulness and reliability comparable to humans; requires neurosymbolic approaches not scaled LLMs","confidence_level":"Conditionally optimistic (requires abandoning LLMs for neurosymbolic AI)","source_name":"Marcus on AI Substack (2024-2025)","source_url":"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/agi-will-not-happen-in-your-lifetime","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","industry-academia-divergence"]}
