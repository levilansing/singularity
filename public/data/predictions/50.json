{"tldr_summary":"British computer scientist Donald Michie surveyed AI researchers in the early 1970s and documented a field deeply divided on AGI timelines. Some respondents confidently predicted 1993—just 20 years out—while others said 50 years (2023), and some insisted human-level AI was fundamentally impossible. The median prediction landed on 2023, which turned out eerily prescient given ChatGPT's late-2022 launch, though what counts as 'human-level' remains hotly contested. The survey captured the field's optimism following early AI successes in game-playing and theorem-proving, before the first AI winter crushed those hopes. Michie's documentation of expert disagreement established a pattern that persists today: AI researchers consistently spread across decades when forecasting AGI, with roughly equal numbers predicting near-term breakthroughs and distant horizons. The 1973 survey became a cautionary tale about AI hype cycles, yet its median estimate's accidental accuracy (depending on how you score GPT-4) suggests that even wild guesses sometimes hit the mark when you average enough expert opinions.","criteria_definition":"Machines achieving human-level intelligence across most cognitive tasks, though specific definition varied among respondents.","confidence_level":"Wide distribution of confidence levels across survey respondents, from certain within 20 years to believing it impossible","source_name":"Michie survey of British and American computer scientists (1973)","source_url":"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/ai-timelines","concept_keys":["agi","survey-drift"]}
