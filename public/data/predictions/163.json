{"tldr_summary":"While AI labs race to announce increasingly aggressive timelines, professional superforecasters—the people who actually make money being right about the future—put their median estimate at 2041 for AGI. This December 2023 forecast represents the cautious middle ground: 28% chance by 2030 (acknowledging recent progress could accelerate), but 50% by 2041 (recognizing hard problems remain). Unlike researchers embedded in the hype cycle or executives with products to sell, Samotsvety's track record comes from prediction markets where overconfidence costs real money. Their relatively conservative timeline suggests that once you remove career incentives and marketing pressure, the smart money still thinks AGI is a couple decades away, not a couple years.","criteria_definition":"AGI defined by adversarial Turing test capability against expert-assisted judges","confidence_level":"Aggregate superforecaster consensus with 28% by 2030 and 50% by 2041","source_name":"Samotsvety Superforecasters","source_url":"https://80000hours.org/2025/03/when-do-experts-expect-agi-to-arrive/","concept_keys":["agi","turing-test"]}
