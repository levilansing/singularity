{"tldr_summary":"Ray Kurzweil's 2005 opus 'The Singularity Is Near' became the techno-optimist's Bible, predicting AGI by 2029 and full human-AI merger by 2045 with zero hedging or uncertainty ranges. The inventor and futurist built his case on the 'Law of Accelerating Returns'—his observation that information technologies improve exponentially, not linearly. Kurzweil's track record on narrow predictions (smartphone ubiquity, computer vision, internet penetration) has been eerily accurate, lending credibility to the big claims. The 652-page book covers everything from nanobot medicine to uploading consciousness, all delivered with the confidence of someone who's been right enough times to ignore skeptics. Critics call him a prophet, a huckster, or both. His 2029 AGI prediction, made 24 years in advance, now sits just years away—close enough that we'll soon know if he nailed it or joined the long list of AI pioneers whose optimism exceeded reality. The book launched a thousand podcasts, inspired countless startups, and made 'the singularity' a mainstream concept. Love him or hate him, Kurzweil moved the conversation.","criteria_definition":"Human-level AGI where machine intelligence matches human capability across all cognitive domains","confidence_level":"Extremely high confidence with specific year, backed by exponential trend analysis","source_name":"The Singularity Is Near (2005)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near","concept_keys":["agi","accelerating-change","industry-academia-divergence"]}
