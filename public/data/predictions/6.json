{"tldr_summary":"Francois Chollet, creator of Keras and the ARC benchmark for measuring general intelligence, argues LLMs are sophisticated memorization engines that lack genuine reasoning and generalization. His timeline of 2038-2048 reflects deep skepticism that scaling transformers solves abstraction and world modeling. Chollet's ARC benchmark remains largely unsolved even by frontier models like GPT-4 and Claude, which he considers evidence we're not as close as the hype suggests. His position: current architectures hit fundamental limits around reasoning and adaptability that require entirely new approaches, not just more parameters. This puts him firmly in the skeptic camp, predicting AGI two decades out while others cluster around 2027-2033. The EA Forum post summarizing expert predictions positioned him as a prominent counterweight to accelerationist timelines.","criteria_definition":"Human-level AI with broad adaptability; skeptical current path gets us there","confidence_level":"Skeptical of current LLM approaches achieving AGI","source_name":"EA Forum discussion (~2024)","source_url":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xkNjpGNfnAYmkFz3s/on-january-1-2030-there-will-be-no-agi-and-agi-will-still","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","industry-academia-divergence"]}
