{"tldr_summary":"Seth Baum, Ben Goertzel, and Ted Goertzel surveyed AI experts in 2011 and discovered what anyone familiar with the field already suspected: nobody has a clue when AGI will arrive. The predictions spanned 70 years—from 2030 to 2100—with a median around 2050. This spectacular lack of agreement tells you more about our ignorance than our knowledge. The survey targeted AGI-specific researchers (not the broader AI field), yet even specialists pursuing human-level AI as their explicit goal couldn't narrow it down beyond 'sometime this century, probably.' The study found experts skeptical that massive funding alone would accelerate progress, especially if concentrated in narrow approaches. Most favored integrative methods combining multiple techniques. The 70-year range essentially means 'we have no idea'—it's like predicting fusion power will arrive 'between next Tuesday and your great-grandchildren's retirement.' The paper's value isn't in the timeline but in documenting expert uncertainty during the post-AI-winter, pre-deep-learning era when AGI research was still a niche pursuit.","criteria_definition":"Artificial General Intelligence with human-like general intelligence across domains","confidence_level":"Extreme variance in expert opinions, no consensus on timing","source_name":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change vol 78 (2011)","source_url":"https://sethbaum.com/ac/2011_AI-Experts.pdf","concept_keys":["agi","survey-drift"]}
