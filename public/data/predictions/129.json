{"tldr_summary":"Masayoshi Son told Saudi investors at the Future Investment Initiative that artificial superintelligence—10,000 times smarter than any human—would arrive 'within about a decade' around 2035. The prediction came with eye-watering infrastructure requirements: 400GW of AI datacenter power (exceeding total US electricity supply), 200 million chips, and $9 trillion in cumulative capex. Son argued this investment is 'reasonable' because super AI producing $9 trillion annually in benefits would make the initial cost 'small money.' He predicted four companies would achieve trillion-dollar profits, adding 'I want to be one of them.' The billionaire's escalating multipliers tell a story: October 2023 he predicted AGI '10 times more intelligent than total human intelligence,' June 2024 he mentioned '10,000 times' for ASI, and now October 2024 he's firmly anchored on the 10,000x figure. Son also adjusted his timeline—moving from 3-5 years for AGI in June to 'about a decade' for full superintelligence. His conviction that Nvidia is undervalued despite being the world's most valuable company shows he's betting everything on this vision materializing.","criteria_definition":"Artificial superintelligence 10,000 times smarter than human brain, requiring 400GW datacenter power and $9 trillion investment","confidence_level":"Very high confidence with specific infrastructure requirements: 400GW power, 200 million chips, $9 trillion capex, suggesting detailed modeling backing prediction","source_name":"Future Investment Initiative Saudi Arabia (October 2024)","source_url":"https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/29/softbank_super_ai/","concept_keys":["superintelligence","industry-academia-divergence"]}
