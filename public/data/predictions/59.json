{"tldr_summary":"Andrew Ng, the AI pioneer who co-founded Google Brain and Coursera, emerged as Silicon Valley's most prominent AGI skeptic in November 2025, declaring that AGI remains 'decades away or longer' in his deeplearning.ai newsletter. Ng argues that current LLMs are 'narrow versus humans,' excelling mainly at text while requiring heavy context engineering for real-world tasks. He wouldn't trust frontier models alone for basic tasks like calendar prioritization, resume screening, or lunch ordering—his team achieved a 'decent resume screening assistant' only after significant customization. This directly contradicts the 2027-2030 consensus building among AI company CEOs. Ng's key insight: while 'thin wrappers' around LLMs will be commoditized, valuable application-layer businesses won't be wiped out because frontier models can't handle domain-specific tasks without substantial customization. For traders, this signals sustained demand for vertical AI integration, data pipelines, and specialized agents over generic chatbot fronts. Ng proposed a 'Turing-AGI Test' measuring multi-day real-world work performance, which no current system passes. His decades-away timeline pushes back against claims that AGI is imminent, grounding expectations in persistent technical limitations rather than extrapolated scaling curves.","criteria_definition":"Artificial general intelligence requiring systems that pass multi-day real-world work performance tests, not just narrow text generation tasks","confidence_level":"High confidence that AGI remains decades away or longer, based on persistent limitations in LLM capabilities despite rapid model progress","source_name":"DeepLearning.AI The Batch newsletter and X/Twitter","source_url":"https://blockchain.news/flashnews/andrew-ng-agi-is-decades-away-application-layer-ai-won-t-be-wiped-out-soon-and-2025-trading-takeaways-for-ai-stocks-and-crypto","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis"]}
