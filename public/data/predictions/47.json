{"tldr_summary":"Vernor Vinge's 1993 presentation at NASA's VISION-21 Symposium became the founding document of Singularity discourse, predicting superintelligence between 2005 and 2030—with 2023 as his median estimate. Vinge laid out four paths: AI computers becoming 'awake,' large networks achieving consciousness, brain-computer interfaces creating cyborgs, or genetic engineering upgrading biology. His key insight? Once any path succeeds, change becomes so rapid and profound that the future becomes fundamentally unpredictable—hence borrowing 'singularity' from astrophysics, where physics breaks down inside black holes. Vinge argued this wasn't science fiction but near-term reality, telling NASA that within three decades we'd create entities smarter than ourselves, ending the human era as decisively as human intelligence ended the pre-human era. His 2023 median prediction lands awkwardly close to ChatGPT's November 2022 arrival, though whether GPT-4 counts as 'superhuman intelligence' depends heavily on definitions. Vinge's essay inspired Kurzweil, Bostrom, and an entire generation of AI researchers to take the Singularity seriously as a forecasting problem rather than just science fiction speculation.","criteria_definition":"Creation of entities with greater-than-human intelligence through AI, networked computers, brain-computer interfaces, or biological enhancement, marking the end of the human era.","confidence_level":"High confidence with specific 30-year window, calling it 'unavoidable' with multiple pathways to achievement","source_name":"The Coming Technological Singularity - NASA VISION-21 Symposium (1993)","source_url":"https://edoras.sdsu.edu/~vinge/misc/singularity.html","concept_keys":["event-horizon"]}
