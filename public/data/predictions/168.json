{"tldr_summary":"Shane Legg, DeepMind co-founder and Chief AGI Scientist, has maintained 50% odds for AGI by 2028 since he first made the prediction in 2009. That's 14 years of refusing to update his timeline despite AlexNet, GPT-3, ChatGPT, and every other breakthrough that made other forecasters radically revise their estimates. In an October 2023 podcast, Legg explained his definition: AGI means machines that can do the cognitive tasks people typically do, possibly more. He acknowledged the difficulty of measuring progress toward such a fuzzy target, suggesting we need a broad range of tests spanning human cognitive abilities. The question is whether Legg's consistency reflects genuine insight into the pace of AI progress or whether he just picked a number and stuck with it. Either way, with 2028 now just a few years away, we're about to find out if his 15-year-old prediction was perfectly calibrated or just a lucky guess that's about to be proven wildly wrong.","criteria_definition":"Machine capable of cognitive tasks people can typically do, meeting human performance across broad range of tests","confidence_level":"50% confidence maintained consistently since 2009; described as personal median estimate","source_name":"Dwarkesh podcast January 2026","source_url":"https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/shane-legg","concept_keys":["agi"]}
