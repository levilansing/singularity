{"tldr_summary":"Emerj polled 32 AI experts and got a three-way split: 45% said singularity before 2060, 34% after 2060, and 21% said never. The never camp argues intelligence has ceiling or requires biology. The before-2060 crowd thinks exponential progress continues. The after crowd hedges it's possible but harder. When a fifth of experts think something will never happen while half say decades, you're looking at educated guesses about unprecedented phenomena, not scientific consensus.","criteria_definition":"Singularity occurrence; 45% predict before 2060, 34% after 2060, 21% never","confidence_level":"45% before 2060, 34% after, 21% never","source_name":"Emerj AI Research survey","source_url":"https://emerj.com/when-will-we-reach-the-singularity-a-timeline-consensus-from-ai-researchers/","concept_keys":["event-horizon","accelerating-change","survey-drift"]}
