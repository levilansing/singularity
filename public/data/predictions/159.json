{"tldr_summary":"While Sam Altman's September 2024 'few thousand days' comment suggested superintelligence around 2032, his January 2025 writings acknowledge the timeline 'may take longer'—pushing the estimate toward 2035 as a reasonable upper bound. The framing positions humanity as having already passed the point of no return: 'This may turn out to be the most consequential fact about all of history so far.' Altman's confidence rests on deep learning's predictable scaling behavior and society's increasing resource dedication to AI development. The 2035 timeline assumes continued exponential progress without major technical barriers, regulatory intervention, or resource constraints. It's notably more conservative than his AGI predictions, reflecting the gap between human-level and vastly-superhuman intelligence. The 'event horizon' language suggests we're already committed to the trajectory regardless of individual decisions—a deterministic framing that minimizes agency while maximizing urgency. Critics note this serves OpenAI's narrative of inevitable transformation requiring massive investment, while skeptics question whether scaling alone delivers superintelligence or hits fundamental limits. The 2035 date is far enough away to be unfalsifiable in the near term but close enough to drive current decision-making and capital allocation.","criteria_definition":"Superintelligence as AI systems dramatically surpassing all human cognitive capabilities across every domain","confidence_level":"High confidence in eventual arrival with acknowledgment that timeline could extend beyond 'few thousand days'","source_name":"The Intelligence Age blog 2025","source_url":"https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections","concept_keys":["superintelligence","accelerating-change","scaling-hypothesis","event-horizon"]}
