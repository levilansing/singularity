{"tldr_summary":"Roman Yampolskiy, an AI safety researcher known for pessimistic takes, dropped a September 2025 prediction that AGI arrives in 2027—followed swiftly by economic apocalypse. By 2030, he claims, unemployment won't hit Great Depression levels of 10% but a staggering 99%, with only five jobs remaining unautomated. His logic: AGI in 2027 gets paired with human-level dexterity robots by 2030, automating everything from coding to plumbing. The prediction appeared on a biotech blog discussing his 'Diary of a CEO' podcast interview, where he laid out a two-phase automation scenario—digital work first, then physical labor within five years. It's one of the most extreme unemployment forecasts from any credentialed researcher, suggesting near-total economic obsolescence of human labor. Whether it's prescient warning or catastrophizing depends on whether you think deep learning scales all the way to general intelligence without hitting walls.","criteria_definition":"AGI capable of outperforming humans at most economically valuable work, rendering 99% of human labor obsolete","confidence_level":"High confidence with detailed unemployment projections of 99% by 2030","source_name":"Diary of a CEO podcast (September 2025)","source_url":"https://blog.biocomm.ai/2025/09/04/dr-roman-yampolskiy-these-are-the-only-5-jobs-that-will-remain-in-2030/","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","economic-singularity","alignment"]}
