{"tldr_summary":"Max Tegmark's 2017 book 'Life 3.0' introduced a framework for thinking about AI evolution: Life 1.0 (biological), Life 2.0 (cultural), and Life 3.0 (technological beings that can redesign their own hardware). The MIT cosmologist and Future of Life Institute founder explores superintelligence scenarios without pinning down exact dates, suggesting it could arrive anywhere from decades to a century away. Tegmark focuses less on timeline certainty and more on what humanity should do to maximize positive outcomes, examining everything from technological unemployment to AI weapons. His deliberately broad range reflects the fundamental uncertainty in predicting recursive self-improvement—once AI can redesign itself, all bets are off. The book became influential in effective altruism circles for its accessible treatment of existential risk without the doomsday urgency of figures like Yudkowsky.","criteria_definition":"AI that can redesign its own hardware and internal structure, not just learn software","confidence_level":"Explores multiple scenarios without committing to specific timeline; focuses on societal implications rather than prediction certainty","source_name":"Life 3.0 / FQXi research 2025","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0","concept_keys":["superintelligence","recursive-self-improvement","economic-singularity"]}
