{"tldr_summary":"Sam Altman's September 2024 essay 'The Intelligence Age' included a striking claim: 'It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I'm confident we'll get there.' The internet immediately did the math—a few thousand days is roughly 2,000-3,000 days, putting superintelligence between 2030-2032, with 2032 as the midpoint. Altman's formulation is deliberately hedged ('it may take longer') while maintaining high confidence in the fundamental trajectory. His argument rests on deep learning's predictable scaling behavior and increasing resource dedication. The essay reads like a manifesto for the coming transformation, promising personal AI teams, virtual tutors, and shared prosperity 'to a degree that seems unimaginable today.' Critics note the prediction conveniently aligns with OpenAI's fundraising narratives and avoids specifics about what 'superintelligence' actually means in practice. The 'few thousand days' framing became instant meme material while also serving as a concrete-ish timeline that's harder to dismiss than vague 'decades away' claims. Whether it's visionary forecasting or marketing genius wrapped in futurism remains to be seen.","criteria_definition":"Superintelligence defined as AI systems significantly surpassing human cognitive abilities across all domains","confidence_level":"Confident in arrival, deliberately imprecise on timeline with 'few thousand days' formulation","source_name":"The Intelligence Age - personal blog (September 23 2024)","source_url":"https://ia.samaltman.com/","concept_keys":["superintelligence","scaling-hypothesis","industry-academia-divergence"]}
