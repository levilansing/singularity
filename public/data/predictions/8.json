{"tldr_summary":"Louis Rosenberg, who built the first functional augmented reality system at Air Force Research Lab, dramatically revised his singularity prediction from around 2050 down to 2030 after observing post-2020 AI progress. His original conservative estimate assumed AGI required breakthroughs we couldn't envision, hedging toward later dates. Then GPT-3 and GPT-4 happened and he pulled his timeline 20 years closer. This revision exemplifies the field-wide timeline compression following the transformer revolution - what seemed like science fiction in 2019 became engineering timelines by 2024. Rosenberg's definition focuses on AI exceeding human abilities broadly across domains rather than philosophical questions about consciousness. His 20-year acceleration represents one of the largest expert timeline revisions on record, though whether this reflects genuine insight or hype contagion remains hotly debated.","criteria_definition":"Singularity: AI exceeding human abilities broadly across domains","confidence_level":"Moderate (revised from earlier 2050 estimate)","source_name":"AIMultiple analysis","source_url":"https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/","concept_keys":["event-horizon"]}
