{"tldr_summary":"In July 2020, before GPT-3 had even been released to the public and years before he'd launch his own xAI company, Elon Musk declared that artificial intelligence would overtake all human capabilities by 2025. The prediction came from the man who's been promising 'full self-driving next year' since 2016, a track record that makes his AGI timeline particularly spicy. What's remarkable isn't just the aggressive five-year window, but that Musk made this call when the AI landscape looked radically different—no ChatGPT, no GPT-4, no widespread transformer model dominance. Yet by early 2025, with models like GPT-4 and Claude showing startling capabilities, Musk's timeline looked less absurd than when he made it. His pattern: predict the impossible on aggressive timelines, miss the exact date, hit something directionally close, declare victory, repeat. The 2025 AGI prediction aged better than his Mars colony or robotaxi timelines, even if AGI itself remains elusive.","criteria_definition":"AI surpassing all human intelligence across all domains","confidence_level":"Stated as definitive timeline without hedging or probabilistic qualification","source_name":"New York Times interview (July 2020)","source_url":"https://www.diamandis.com/blog/age-of-abundance-30-human-level-ai","concept_keys":["agi","industry-academia-divergence"]}
