{"tldr_summary":"Nathan Young and Rob Gordon of Goodheart Labs built the meta-dashboard to end all meta-dashboards, aggregating predictions from Metaculus, Manifold Markets, Kalshi, and other forecasting platforms into a single AGI timeline. The verdict as of January 2026: median arrival 2031, with 80% confidence stretching from 2027 to 2045. That 18-year spread isn't a bug—it's an honest representation of how much disagreement exists even among professional forecasters who've studied this intensely. The dashboard tracks multiple definitions: \"weakly general AI,\" \"general AI,\" and AI passing \"difficult adversarial Turing tests,\" each with slightly different timelines. What's remarkable is the convergence: despite different methodologies and participant pools, the central tendency keeps landing in the early 2030s. Funded by Jaan Tallinn (Skype co-founder turned existential risk philanthropist), the dashboard updates continuously as prediction markets shift, offering a real-time pulse check on humanity's collective best guess about when machines might match human cognition.","criteria_definition":"First general AI system or weakly general AI passing high-quality adversarial Turing test","confidence_level":"80% confidence interval spanning 18 years reflects genuine uncertainty across multiple forecasting methodologies","source_name":"AGI Timelines Dashboard (January 5 2026)","source_url":"https://agi.goodheartlabs.com/","concept_keys":["agi","turing-test","prediction-markets"]}
