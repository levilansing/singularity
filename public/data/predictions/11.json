{"tldr_summary":"Tom Davidson built a compute-centric framework that treats transformative AI as an economic modeling problem: when does compute scaling enable full labor automation? The model's best guess lands at 2040, but the confidence intervals are hilariously wide - the aggressive preset hits 2027 while the conservative preset says never. This captures the field's fundamental uncertainty: if you believe scaling laws continue indefinitely, AGI is around the corner; if you think we hit diminishing returns, it could be centuries away. Davidson's framework is rigorous quantitative forecasting that essentially says we're parameterizing our ignorance with math. Open Philanthropy uses this model to allocate hundreds of millions in AI safety funding, which means someone's billion-dollar decisions rest on assumptions about compute trends nobody can verify.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI via compute-centric framework; uses GWP and compute trends to model labor automation timelines","confidence_level":"Model-based estimate with wide uncertainty","source_name":"Open Philanthropy takeoff speeds model - Alignment Forum","source_url":"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Gc9FGtdXhK9sCSEYu/what-a-compute-centric-framework-says-about-ai-takeoff","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis","economic-singularity","alignment","industry-academia-divergence"]}
