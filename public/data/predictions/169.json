{"tldr_summary":"Stuart Russell, whose AI textbook has educated more than 1,500 universities in 135 countries, thinks AGI is about 19 years away—and he's not even confident we're on the right path to get there. In an 80,000 Hours podcast, Russell suggested roughly 30% odds that AGI cannot be built under the current deep learning paradigm, requiring fundamental architectural breakthroughs we haven't discovered yet. This is notably more skeptical than most predictions from people actively building AI systems, which makes sense: Russell has spent decades studying the field's limitations, not just its successes. His 2044 timeline reflects both technical skepticism (current approaches may hit walls) and philosophical concern (we're building systems we don't understand how to control). Unlike researchers racing to the next benchmark, Russell approaches AGI as an academic problem that might not have a solution on the current path. Whether this makes him a wise voice of caution or someone who will be proven wrong by empirical progress remains to be seen.","criteria_definition":"AGI requiring multiple fundamental breakthroughs beyond current deep learning paradigm","confidence_level":"Low confidence; estimates 30% chance current AI paradigm cannot achieve AGI without fundamental breakthroughs","source_name":"Diary of a CEO podcast / 80,000 Hours","source_url":"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/stuart-russell-human-compatible-ai/","concept_keys":["agi"]}
