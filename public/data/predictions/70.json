{"tldr_summary":"This isn't a podcast hot take or conference soundbite—Anthropic submitted official recommendations to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in March 2025 stating they expect 'powerful AI systems' by late 2026 or early 2027. Their definition: Nobel Prize winner-level intelligence across biology, computer science, mathematics, and engineering. The kicker: cluster sizes will enable 'millions of AI instances' running simultaneously at superhuman speed, creating what Amodei calls 'a country of geniuses in a datacenter.' Some interpretations suggest 50 million genius-level agents. Anthropic's newer essay 'The Adolescence of Technology' (January 2026) describes this as 'the single most serious national security threat' in a century. So they're simultaneously building it and warning the government about it, which is either responsible or the most elaborate liability shield in corporate history. The company's $350B valuation is explicitly tied to this timeline's credibility—investors are betting Anthropic delivers superintelligence within 18 months. This is the forecasting equivalent of going all-in on a poker hand while filing an insurance claim on your chips. The 2027 countdown is now official U.S. government correspondence, which means when historians write about how we handled the AGI transition, this document will be Exhibit A.","criteria_definition":"Powerful AI with intellectual capabilities matching Nobel Prize winners across most disciplines, scalable to millions of instances","confidence_level":"Extremely high confidence—this is Anthropic's official company position submitted to White House OSTP, not just CEO speculation","source_name":"Anthropic position paper 2025","source_url":"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gabPgK9e83QrmcvbK/what-s-up-with-anthropic-predicting-agi-by-early-2027-1","concept_keys":["agi","economic-singularity"]}
