{"tldr_summary":"Baobao Zhang's 2019 survey framed AGI economically: when will AI outperform median humans at 90%+ of work tasks? The median answer of 2060 suggested four more decades of job security, reflecting pre-GPT skepticism that machines could handle the full breadth of human work. The framing was smart - forget philosophical debates about consciousness and understanding, just ask when robots take your job. This makes the prediction falsifiable and practically meaningful in ways vague AGI definitions aren't. The survey came before GPT-3 rewrote everyone's priors about language AI and before image models made art generation trivial. Respondents in 2019 probably couldn't imagine AI writing code, analyzing complex documents, or generating photorealistic images, yet all that arrived by 2023. The 90% threshold is deliberately high - we might hit 50% or even 80% of tasks while the final 10-20% prove surprisingly hard, creating an economy where AI handles most jobs but humans still fill crucial gaps. The 2060 timeline captured 2019's conventional wisdom that AGI was safely distant, which aged poorly after 2022 made everyone update their forecasts two decades closer.","criteria_definition":"AI outperforming median human worker at over 90% of economically relevant tasks","confidence_level":"50% before 2060; when machines outperform median humans at 90%+ tasks","source_name":"Forecasting AI Progress survey (arXiv)","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04132","concept_keys":["agi","economic-singularity","survey-drift"]}
