{"tldr_summary":"In a formal March 2025 submission to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, Anthropic didn't just predict AGI—they made it official U.S. government policy discourse. The company expects \"powerful AI\" matching Nobel laureates across biology, computer science, math, and engineering by late 2026 or early 2027, describing it as \"a country of geniuses in a datacenter.\" This isn't Dario Amodei musing on a podcast; it's Anthropic's institutional position submitted to inform federal AI policy. The document requests 50 gigawatts of dedicated power by 2027 (enough to run multiple cities) because training a single frontier model will soon require 5 gigawatts. They're asking the White House to prepare for economic transformation, modernize data collection, and strengthen national security—all predicated on superhuman AI arriving within the current presidential administration. When you're filing official paperwork requesting continental-scale power infrastructure, you're not hedging.","criteria_definition":"AI systems matching Nobel Prize-level intellectual capabilities across most disciplines with autonomous digital interface control","confidence_level":"Formal policy submission to White House OSTP representing official company position, not just CEO speculation","source_name":"Anthropic OSTP submission for AI Action Plan (March 2025)","source_url":"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gabPgK9e83QrmcvbK/what-s-up-with-anthropic-predicting-agi-by-early-2027-1","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","economic-singularity","industry-academia-divergence"]}
