{"tldr_summary":"Katja Grace surveyed 352 ML researchers and found shocking geography: Asians predicted AGI 44 years sooner than North Americans (2046 vs 2089). The 2061 median was pre-GPT baseline. Grace's 2022 follow-up showed 13-year compression in six years of progress. The geographic split remains unexplained - cultural optimism? Watching Chinese AI? The survey predicted AI would master truck driving before surgery, and retail before writing bestsellers, which aged interestingly as LLMs dominated creative tasks first.","criteria_definition":"HLMI: machines do every task better and cheaper","confidence_level":"50% in 45 years; Asians 44 years sooner","source_name":"When Will AI Exceed Human Performance? - JAIR vol 62 (2018)","source_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08807","concept_keys":["agi","survey-drift"]}
