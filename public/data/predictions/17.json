{"tldr_summary":"Shane Legg, who literally coined the term artificial general intelligence and co-founded DeepMind, has maintained 50% odds on AGI by 2028 since way back in 2011. His consistency across 12 years of hype cycles and AI winters lends serious credibility - this is not someone adjusting forecasts based on headlines. As DeepMind's chief AGI scientist working on Gemini, he has inside knowledge of capability scaling and architectural limitations. Legg's definition is concrete: an AI that reliably handles the full range of human cognitive tasks, not philosophical questions about consciousness. His 80% by 2037 upper bound suggests even if 2028 misses, he expects AGI within 15 years maximum. The fact that someone this embedded in frontier AI research has barely moved his timeline despite AlphaGo, GPT-3, and everything since suggests either remarkable foresight in 2011 or stubborn commitment to an old prediction. Either way, we're close enough to 2028 to find out if the man who named AGI can predict it.","criteria_definition":"Minimal AGI: artificial agent reliably performing full range of cognitive tasks of average human; coined the term AGI","confidence_level":"50% by 2028; 80% by 2037; maintained since 2011","source_name":"DeepMind official podcast (late 2023)","source_url":"https://80000hours.org/2025/03/when-do-experts-expect-agi-to-arrive/","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","industry-academia-divergence"]}
