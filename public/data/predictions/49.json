{"tldr_summary":"Vernor Vinge didn't just predict the Singularity—he named it, borrowing the term from astrophysics in his 1983 writings. Just as a gravitational singularity marks the point inside a black hole where physics breaks down and predictions become impossible, Vinge's technological singularity marks when superintelligent AI makes the future fundamentally unknowable. The metaphor was brilliant: it captured both the sudden phase transition (human-level to superhuman in potentially hours or days through recursive self-improvement) and our epistemic blindness beyond that point. Before Vinge, people talked about 'artificial intelligence' or 'machine consciousness,' but the singularity framing emphasized the event horizon—we can't see past it because entities smarter than us will make decisions we can't anticipate using reasoning we can't follow. The term stuck because it conveyed both the drama and the genuine uncertainty. Vinge's 1993 NASA presentation popularized the concept widely, but he'd been developing the idea since the early 1980s, making him the intellectual godfather of modern Singularity discourse.","criteria_definition":"The point beyond which superintelligent AI makes the future fundamentally unpredictable, like a black hole's event horizon in physics.","confidence_level":"No predictive confidence stated; conceptual framework rather than timeline forecast","source_name":"First Word - Omni magazine (January 1983)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity","concept_keys":["event-horizon","recursive-self-improvement"]}
