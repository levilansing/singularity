{"tldr_summary":"Kenneth Hayworth, a neuroscientist studying perception, tackles the ultimate sci-fi question: can you upload your mind to a computer? His answer is refreshingly honest—theoretically yes, practically not for at least 50 years for the first successful upload, and nearly a century before it becomes routine. The challenge isn't just copying 86 billion neurons and their trillions of connections; it's replicating the entire sensory experience that keeps consciousness functioning. Hayworth points out that sensory deprivation—total darkness or silence—drives people insane within hours. An uploaded mind would need a complete simulation of sight, sound, touch, smell, movement, heart rate, circadian rhythm, and thousands of other inputs the brain constantly processes. Without those inputs, you wouldn't be 'you' in a digital paradise; you'd be a consciousness trapped in sensory hell. The brain is considered the most complex object in the known universe, and Hayworth argues we've barely begun to understand it, let alone replicate it. His timeline acknowledges that while science has a track record of achieving the impossible—Moon landings, genome sequencing, smallpox eradication—the gap between 'theoretically possible' and 'actually achievable' can span generations. It's a sobering reminder that uploading your consciousness to escape mortality is not a retirement plan for anyone reading this.","criteria_definition":"Complete digital replication of consciousness requiring full sensory simulation and 86 billion neuron connections.","confidence_level":"Low to medium confidence based on fundamental neuroscience limitations and complexity of brain replication","source_name":"Neuroscience research on mind uploading","source_url":"https://news.gatech.edu/news/2025/05/23/can-you-upload-human-mind-computer-neuroscientist-ponders-whats-possible","concept_keys":["transformative-ai"]}
