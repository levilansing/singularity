{"tldr_summary":"Daniel Kokotajlo left OpenAI's governance team and immediately launched AI 2027, a project centered on transformative AI arriving within four years of his departure. His insider perspective makes this especially unsettling - he saw OpenAI's internal roadmaps and scaling curves, concluded AGI was imminent, then decided the company wasn't taking safety seriously enough to stick around. So he quit and started publicly warning that we're racing toward capabilities nobody can control. His 2027 median represents what someone with direct access to frontier lab progress thinks is realistic, which is either incredibly informed or incredibly alarming. Probably both. The project argues companies are building toward AGI with safety as an afterthought, and Kokotajlo's resignation adds credibility to the urgency. When insiders leave cushy jobs to sound the alarm, you listen.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI; radical economic transformation and automation","confidence_level":"Median 2027 estimate","source_name":"LessWrong discussion and AI 2027 project","source_url":"https://ai-2027.com/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis","economic-singularity","alignment"]}
