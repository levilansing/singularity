{"tldr_summary":"Geoffrey Hinton's most alarming prediction isn't about when AGI arrives—it's about what happens next. He warns superintelligence could emerge in days once AGI is achieved, via recursive self-improvement that accelerates exponentially. The theory: digital intelligence has no biological constraints on speed, can instantly copy knowledge, and can modify itself. Once AI reaches human-level and can improve its own code, it enters a feedback loop: smarter AI improves itself faster, which makes it smarter, which makes improvement faster still. The 'intelligence explosion' could compress decades of advancement into days or weeks. This is the 'fast takeoff' scenario that makes AI safety researchers wake up in cold sweats—because it means zero time to implement safeguards once you recognize the threat. All safety work must be done before AGI, because afterward you're just a slower intelligence watching a faster one decide your fate. Hinton's warning: don't assume we'll have months or years to respond. By the time we recognize the danger, it might already be too late.","criteria_definition":"Superintelligence emerging within days of AGI achievement via recursive self-improvement","confidence_level":"Moderate confidence in fast takeoff scenario once AGI threshold is reached","source_name":"May 2023 interviews","source_url":"https://x.com/geoffreyhinton/status/1653687894534504451","concept_keys":["superintelligence","recursive-self-improvement","intelligence-explosion","accelerating-change","alignment"]}
