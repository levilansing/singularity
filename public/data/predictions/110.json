{"tldr_summary":"At Nvidia's GTC 2024 developer conference, CEO Jensen Huang told press he's \"really bored\" of AGI questions—then spent quality time answering them anyway. His take: AGI arrives in 5 years if you define it as AI passing every human test (bar exams, medical licensing, logic puzzles) while performing 8% better than most people. That's a narrower definition than most researchers use—it excludes common sense reasoning, embodiment, and general-purpose learning—but it's pragmatically measurable. Huang compared it to knowing when you've arrived at the San Jose Convention Center: clear destination, obvious arrival. The subtext is impossible to miss: Huang runs the company selling the shovels (GPUs) in the AGI gold rush, so his optimism is, shall we say, financially aligned. Every year of AGI development means billions in GPU sales. But Huang's not wrong that definition matters enormously—one person's AGI is another's \"really good test-taking software.\" His prediction is both self-serving and intellectually honest: yes, we'll hit his definition soon, but that might not be the AGI you're thinking of.","criteria_definition":"AGI defined as AI passing human tests (bar exams, medical boards, logic tests) performing 8% better than most people","confidence_level":"High confidence conditional on narrow definition; explicitly notes AGI timeline depends on how you define it","source_name":"GTC Conference and Stanford Economic Forum (March 2024)","source_url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/agi-and-hallucinations/","concept_keys":["agi","industry-academia-divergence"]}
