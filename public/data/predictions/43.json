{"tldr_summary":"Hans Moravec's 1998 paper in the Journal of Evolution and Technology laid out a methodical path to robot domination: count the brain's neurons and synapses, estimate computational requirements, then extrapolate hardware trends. His conclusion? By the 2020s we'd have the raw computing power; by 2040-2050, robots would outperform humans at literally every job. Moravec's approach—tracking computer vision progress from 1 MIPS (following a white line) to 10,000 MIPS (recognizing 3D objects in clutter)—showed how capabilities scaled with processing power. He predicted learning algorithms would become increasingly important as computers grew more powerful, a forecast that aged remarkably well given modern deep learning. Moravec also emphasized that once machines match human intelligence, they'll quickly surpass it—no biological constraints on clock speed or neuron density. His timeline has slid rightward over the years (his 1988 book predicted 2010-2030), but his neuron-counting methodology remains influential in AI forecasting circles.","criteria_definition":"Robots capable of performing every job humans can do, with no task where humans maintain superiority.","confidence_level":"Moderate to high confidence based on hardware extrapolation and neuroscience progress estimates","source_name":"When Will Computer Hardware Match the Human Brain? - Journal of Transhumanism (1998)","source_url":"https://jetpress.org/volume1/moravec.pdf","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis"]}
