{"tldr_summary":"In their January 2023 update, Samotsvety's elite forecasting team assigned 10% probability to AGI arriving within the year—notably higher than most experts would stomach for such near-term AGI. But the real story is their breathtaking uncertainty: the gap between their 10% and 90% confidence bounds spans 138 years, from 2026 to 2164. This isn't wishy-washy hedging; it's professional forecasters honestly admitting they have no idea if this is five years away or requires centuries of breakthroughs. Individual forecasters ranged from aggressive (F1 giving 39% by 2030) to conservative (F9 at 23%), but all agreed on one thing: massive uncertainty. The geometric mean settled on 2041 as the median, making this simultaneously one of the most aggressive and most uncertain AGI forecasts on record.","criteria_definition":"System passing adversarial Turing test with top-5% human judge having expert access","confidence_level":"Mean aggregate with 10% this year, 50% by 2041, 90% by 2164; 138-year confidence interval reflects extreme uncertainty among individual forecasters","source_name":"EA Forum - Update to Samotsvety AGI Timelines (January 2026)","source_url":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ByBBqwRXWqX5m9erL/update-to-samotsvety-agi-timelines","concept_keys":["agi","turing-test","survey-drift"]}
