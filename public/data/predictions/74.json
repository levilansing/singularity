{"tldr_summary":"At the December 2025 Axios AI+ Summit, Demis Hassabis doubled down on his ~2030 AGI timeline but emphasized \"we're definitely not there now\" and need \"one or two more big breakthroughs\" at the level of Transformers or AlphaGo. The most entertaining moment came earlier at Google I/O when Sergey Brin crashed the stage and the two publicly disagreed on whether AGI arrives \"just before\" (Brin) or \"just after\" (Hassabis) 2030—splitting hairs over mere months when predicting humanity's most consequential technological threshold. This precision in hedging reveals how seriously Google takes these predictions while simultaneously acknowledging massive uncertainty. Hassabis stressed that current scaling alone won't suffice; fundamental paradigm shifts are required. When two of the world's smartest technologists can't agree within a 12-month window on a 5-year prediction, it tells you everything about the epistemic chaos surrounding AGI timelines. At least they're honest about not knowing.","criteria_definition":"AI systems capable of outthinking humans across general domains, requiring Transformer-level or AlphaGo-level breakthrough innovations","confidence_level":"Approximately 50% probability, with public precision splitting hairs between 'just before' and 'just after' 2030","source_name":"Axios December 2025","source_url":"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/05/ai-deepmind-gemini-agi","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis"]}
