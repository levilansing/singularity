{"tldr_summary":"Ajeya Cotra, senior researcher at Open Philanthropy who previously worked at OpenAI, produced one of the most rigorous AGI timeline analyses by calculating training compute requirements. Her 'biological anchors' framework estimates the computational power needed to match human brain processing, then projects when that compute becomes economically feasible. The result: 50% probability of transformative AI by 2040, making her 'the reasonable one' among AI forecasters. Unlike CEOs promising AGI within 3-5 years or skeptics pushing it beyond 2100, Cotra's compute-based methodology grounds predictions in measurable hardware trends and scaling laws. Her analysis considers multiple scenarios—from training systems comparable to human lifetime learning to matching evolution's total computation—and weights them by plausibility. The 2040 median sits roughly 15 years later than predictions from AI company leaders but decades earlier than traditional skeptics. Cotra's framework has become influential in AI safety and policy circles precisely because it replaces vibes-based timelines with quantifiable metrics, even as the underlying assumptions about compute requirements remain hotly debated.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI capable of performing tasks requiring human-level cognitive abilities, based on training compute scaling to match human brain computation","confidence_level":"50% probability based on detailed biological anchors analysis of training compute requirements and hardware scaling trajectories","source_name":"AI researcher survey 2023","source_url":"https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/","concept_keys":["scaling-hypothesis","biological-anchors","economic-singularity","alignment"]}
