{"tldr_summary":"In a refreshing burst of intellectual honesty, Geoffrey Hinton maintains his 5-20 year AGI timeline while explicitly admitting he has zero confidence in the estimate. It's the rare prediction that comes with a built-in disclaimer: 'I changed my mind from 30-50 years to 5-20 years, but honestly, who knows?' This humility is notable coming from someone who could coast on Nobel Prize authority. Hinton's uncertainty reflects the field's fundamental problem: we don't actually understand intelligence well enough to predict when we'll recreate it. His timeline revision was driven by being 'stunned' by GPT-4's capabilities, but he's clear that surprise itself proves we're navigating without a map. The 5-20 year range is less a confident forecast than an admission that things are moving faster than expected while remaining fundamentally unpredictable. It's the prediction equivalent of 'I don't know, but I'm more worried than I used to be.'","criteria_definition":"AGI timeline with explicit acknowledgment of complete uncertainty about actual arrival date","confidence_level":"Explicitly states zero confidence in timeline; revised from 30-50 years to 5-20 years but emphasizes uncertainty","source_name":"Fortune interview (December 2025)","source_url":"https://fortune.com/2025/12/28/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-2026-prediction-human-worker-replacement/","concept_keys":["agi","event-horizon"]}
