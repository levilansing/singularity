{"tldr_summary":"On page 2 of his influential 1967 textbook 'Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines,' Marvin Minsky made a sweeping prediction that would haunt AI for decades: 'Within a generation, I am convinced, few compartments of intellect will remain outside the machine's realm.' A generation typically spans 25-30 years, placing his target around 1992-1997. The MIT AI lab founder's confidence was absolute—the problem of creating artificial intelligence would be 'substantially solved' before the millennium. By 1982, after watching his timeline crumble, Minsky admitted 'The AI problem is one of the hardest science has ever undertaken.' He spent the next 40 years recalibrating expectations while navigating multiple AI winters. Each promised corner turned out farther away than expected, but Minsky never stopped believing AGI was just ahead—a faith that outlasted his predictions by decades.","criteria_definition":"Artificial intelligence problem substantially solved, with machines handling the full range of problems to which human mind has been applied","confidence_level":"Convinced that within a generation, few compartments of intellect would remain outside the machine's realm","source_name":"Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines (1967)","source_url":"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2021/03/04/ai-solved/","concept_keys":["agi"]}
