{"tldr_summary":"Rodney Brooks, founder of iRobot and Rethink Robotics and former MIT CSAIL director, consistently pushes back against aggressive AGI timelines, suggesting 2050-2100 is more realistic. His skepticism stems from hands-on robotics experience: people working with physical AI systems—robots that must navigate real-world complexity, physics, and safety constraints—develop deep appreciation for how hard general intelligence actually is. Brooks argues that researchers working purely in software (language models, game-playing AI) systematically underestimate the difficulty because they don't confront the messiness of physical reality. His position isn't that AGI is impossible, but that the path is far longer and harder than current hype suggests. As someone who's spent decades trying to make robots perform 'simple' tasks like navigating homes or manipulating objects, Brooks has earned his skepticism. The gulf between a chatbot that sounds intelligent and a system that can actually function autonomously in the real world remains enormous—a point often lost in discussions dominated by language model capabilities.","criteria_definition":"AGI with robust real-world capabilities including physical interaction, common sense reasoning, and adaptability","confidence_level":"Low confidence in near-term AGI; high confidence that roboticists understand the difficulty better than software-only AI researchers","source_name":"Roboticist commentary","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks","concept_keys":["agi","alignment"]}
