{"tldr_summary":"Ajeya Cotra's biological anchors approach calculates how much compute evolution spent developing human brains, then extrapolates when we'll hit that threshold artificially. Her original 2050 median for transformative AI became the rationalist community's reference forecast, grounding speculative timelines in actual transistor counts and synaptic calculations. Then GPT-4 happened and scaling laws exceeded expectations, so she moved it to 2040 - a decade closer. The methodology treats AGI as inevitable once you match nature's compute bill, which is either rigorous quantitative reasoning or the most elaborate anchoring bias in forecasting history. Critics note evolution had billions of years and massive parallelism while being hilariously inefficient, so maybe copying its homework isn't the right approach. But at least Cotra's framework makes explicit assumptions you can argue about instead of vibes-based timelines. Her revision from 2050 to 2040 foreshadowed the timeline compression that would accelerate dramatically after ChatGPT's release.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI via biological anchors: estimates compute to match evolutionary and neural development","confidence_level":"50% by 2040 (revised from 2050); compute-based analysis","source_name":"Open Philanthropy updated report (2022)","source_url":"https://80000hours.org/2025/03/when-do-experts-expect-agi-to-arrive/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis","biological-anchors","economic-singularity"]}
