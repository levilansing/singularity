{"tldr_summary":"Katja Grace's 2022 survey of 352 machine learning researchers found median HLMI (High-Level Machine Intelligence) predictions at 2059 - nearly four decades out. Just five months later, ChatGPT launched and made those timelines look quaint. The survey captured pre-GPT conventional wisdom: AGI was distant, scaling laws were interesting but not transformative, and we had plenty of time to figure things out. Researchers estimated 50% odds within 45 years and 90% within a century, suggesting genuine uncertainty about whether AGI was decades or lifetimes away. The geographic split was fascinating: Asian researchers predicted 2046 while North Americans said 2089, a 44-year gap. Then late 2022 happened and everyone scrambled to update their priors. Grace's follow-up survey in 2023 compressed the median 13 years from 2060 to 2047, the fastest timeline shift ever recorded. The 2022 survey serves as a time capsule of pre-transformer-hype consensus, when AGI felt safely distant and we could all relax. Those were simpler times.","criteria_definition":"HLMI: unaided machines accomplish every task better and cheaper than human workers; 352 researchers surveyed","confidence_level":"50% within 45 years (median from 2022 survey)","source_name":"AI Impacts 2022 Expert Survey on Progress in AI","source_url":"https://wiki.aiimpacts.org/doku.php?id=ai_timelines:predictions_of_human-level_ai_timelines:ai_timeline_surveys:2022_expert_survey_on_progress_in_ai","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","survey-drift"]}
