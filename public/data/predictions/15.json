{"tldr_summary":"Jürgen Schmidhuber, who invented LSTMs (the neural architecture behind early language models), suggests singularity predictions might suffer from temporal parochialism - every generation thinks they're living through history's most important moment. He notes the frequency of notable events seems to accelerate as we approach the present, but that's partly our near-sighted view privileging recent developments. Older predictions from the 1970s saying AGI by 1985 look ridiculous now; will 2027 predictions look equally silly by 2040? Despite this metacognitive caution, Schmidhuber still puts the singularity around 2050 and muses about AI eventually colonizing the solar system, then galaxy, then universe over tens of billions of years. His philosophical humility about timeline predictions combined with cosmic-scale speculation captures the field's tension between epistemological modesty and transhumanist ambition. Maybe we're experiencing something unprecedented, or maybe we're just the latest generation to think so.","criteria_definition":"Singularity: AGI emergence with frequency of notable events appearing to accelerate","confidence_level":"Moderate estimate; notes singularity timeline might be perception bias","source_name":"Various interviews (~2023)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity","concept_keys":["event-horizon","scaling-hypothesis"]}
