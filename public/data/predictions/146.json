{"tldr_summary":"Ray Kurzweil, Google's Director of Engineering and professional futurist, has maintained his 2029 human-level AI prediction since 1999—and refuses to update it despite 27 years of new information. What makes this particularly interesting is his track record: 86% of his 147 predictions about 2009 (made in 1999) were correct within one year. When he first made the 2029 call at a Stanford conference in 2000, he was literally the only person who thought AGI would arrive that soon; 80% of experts agreed it would happen but estimated a hundred years. Now his prediction is considered mainstream, even conservative. Kurzweil's methodology relies on exponential curves in computing power, Moore's Law extrapolation, and calculating when brain simulation becomes computationally feasible. His 2024 book 'The Singularity is Nearer' doubles down on 2029, citing recent LLM progress as validation. The meta-observation here: maintaining the exact same prediction for three decades while the world catches up to you is either remarkable foresight or spectacular stubbornness.","criteria_definition":"AI capable of performing any cognitive task an educated human can perform, passing Turing Test indistinguishably","confidence_level":"High confidence maintained consistently since 1999; based on 86% historical accuracy rate on previous predictions","source_name":"Popular Mechanics 2024","source_url":"https://www.teamday.ai/ai/ray-kurzweil-moonshots-agi-2029-singularity","concept_keys":["agi","accelerating-change","turing-test"]}
