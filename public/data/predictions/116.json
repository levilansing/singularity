{"tldr_summary":"Forget surveys and punditry—on Kalshi, the first CFTC-regulated prediction market in the US, traders are putting actual money where their predictions are. Currently, the market prices a 42% probability that OpenAI achieves AGI before 2030, with over $537,000 in trading volume on these specific contracts. That's a 10% increase from six months ago, following GPT-5's launch. The stakes matter because these aren't play-money predictions—traders face real financial consequences for being wrong, which typically produces more calibrated forecasts than expert surveys or corporate announcements. The resolution criteria are tied to OpenAI's own internal definition of AGI, which is significant because OpenAI has financial incentives in their Microsoft partnership linked to achieving AGI. The market's 42% odds imply roughly 10% annual probability over the next four years, suggesting traders take OpenAI's roadmaps seriously. Weekly volume across all AI-related contracts on major platforms hit nearly $6 billion as of February 2026, indicating this isn't a niche curiosity—it's become a real-time sentiment barometer for the most consequential technological transition in human history. When people risk their own capital, the hype tends to get filtered out fast.","criteria_definition":"AGI as defined by OpenAI's internal criteria, determined by OpenAI board with Microsoft partnership implications.","confidence_level":"42% probability represents real-money market consensus with significant trading volume","source_name":"Kalshi prediction market","source_url":"https://kalshi.com/markets/kxoaiagi/openai-achieves-agi/oaiagi","concept_keys":["agi","prediction-markets"]}
