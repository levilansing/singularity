{"tldr_summary":"Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's co-founder and chief scientist, sat down with Dwarkesh Patel in March 2023 and casually dropped AGI predictions like he was forecasting next quarter's earnings. His timeline: 5-10 years, delivered with the same certainty as predicting another iPhone release. \"At some point we really will have AGI. Maybe OpenAI will build it. Maybe some other company will build it,\" he said, as if discussing inevitable product launches rather than potential species-level transformation. Sutskever discussed next-token prediction potentially surpassing human intelligence, the difficulty of aligning superhuman AI, and what comes after generative models. The interview's tone is striking—no hedging, no \"if we solve these ten hard problems,\" just matter-of-fact expectation that AGI arrives this decade. Coming from the scientist who helped invent modern deep learning and led the team that built GPT-4, this isn't idle speculation. It's the guy building the thing telling you when to expect delivery, and the delivery date is uncomfortably soon.","criteria_definition":"Artificial general intelligence with human-level cognitive capabilities across domains","confidence_level":"Treats AGI arrival as inevitable as next iPhone release; high confidence with matter-of-fact delivery","source_name":"Dwarkesh podcast","source_url":"https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ilya-sutskever","concept_keys":["agi"]}
