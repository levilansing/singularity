{"tldr_summary":"When AGI researchers gathered for their inaugural conference in 2009, they surveyed each other on when human-level AI would actually arrive. The median prediction landed on 2050, with a 40-year spread from 2030 to 2070—basically admitting 'we think mid-century, but honestly could be our kids or our grandkids.' This was post-AI-winter thinking, after decades of hype cycles had crashed. The field had learned painful lessons about overpromising, and these predictions reflected that caution. AGI-09 marked a turning point where researchers pursuing general intelligence as an explicit goal (rather than narrow applications) started organizing as a distinct community. The survey found strong disagreement on milestones and methods, but consensus that human-level AI deserved serious research attention. Most favored integrative approaches combining multiple techniques rather than betting everything on one paradigm. The 2050 median represented a Goldilocks estimate—far enough away to avoid looking foolish if progress stalled, near enough to justify current research funding. The 40-year uncertainty range was the honest part: nobody really knew.","criteria_definition":"Human-level artificial general intelligence with capability equaling human cognitive performance","confidence_level":"Moderate confidence with significant variance, reflecting post-AI-winter realism","source_name":"Baum et al.
