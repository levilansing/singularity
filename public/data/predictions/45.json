{"tldr_summary":"By 1994, Marvin Minsky—co-founder of MIT's AI Lab and one of the field's founding fathers—had evolved from making specific AGI predictions to writing philosophical treatises about humanity's obsolescence. His Scientific American essay 'Will Robots Inherit the Earth?' argued that advanced robots built with nanotechnology would inevitably surpass and replace biological humans, becoming our evolutionary successors. After decades of overpromising AI timelines (he famously said in the 1960s that machine intelligence was a problem for 'a generation'), an older Minsky pivoted to big-picture philosophical questions rather than dates. He explored why robots might be better suited for space exploration and long-term survival, suggesting humans were just a transitional form—biological bootloaders for our mechanical descendants. Minsky's shift from 'AGI in 10 years' to 'robots will inherit the Earth eventually' reflects how repeated prediction failures humbled even the field's most optimistic pioneers. His later work focused more on understanding intelligence itself rather than predicting when we'd recreate it artificially.","criteria_definition":"Robots achieving sufficient capability through nanotechnology and recursive improvement to become humanity's evolutionary successors.","confidence_level":"No specific confidence stated; philosophical exploration rather than predictive forecast","source_name":"Will Robots Inherit the Earth? - Scientific American (1994)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity","concept_keys":["event-horizon"]}
