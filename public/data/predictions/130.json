{"tldr_summary":"Masayoshi Son revised his AGI timeline yet again in February 2025, moving the prediction from 2028 to 2027—his third major revision in 16 months. The pattern tells the story: October 2023 he predicted AGI by 2033 (10 years out), June 2024 he moved it to 2028 (3-5 years), and now February 2025 he's landed on 2027 (2 years away). Each revision compresses the timeline further, suggesting either adaptive forecasting as capabilities progress faster than expected or chronic overoptimism that keeps pulling predictions closer. Son's serial revisions make him the most aggressive timeline compressor among major investors—while others maintain consistent predictions, he continuously updates shorter. This analysis comes from AIMultiple's comprehensive survey of 9,300 predictions across 8 peer-reviewed papers, 15 AI experts, and prediction markets. Son's behavior reveals something important about AGI forecasting: predictions aren't static prophecies but dynamic reactions to unfolding progress. Whether his constant acceleration toward nearer-term AGI reflects superior pattern recognition or wishful thinking remains the trillion-dollar question.","criteria_definition":"Artificial general intelligence matching or exceeding human-level cognitive abilities across broad range of tasks","confidence_level":"High confidence with pattern of continuous timeline compression: 2033→2028→2027, suggesting reactive updating based on capability progress","source_name":"SoftBank enterprise event Tokyo (February 2025)","source_url":"https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/","concept_keys":["agi","industry-academia-divergence"]}
