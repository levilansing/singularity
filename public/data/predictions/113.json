{"tldr_summary":"In a rare moment of futurist humility, Jürgen Schmidhuber—one of the fathers of modern deep learning—has walked back his timeline considerably. Back in the 1970s, young Schmidhuber thought AI was coming 'soon.' Now, after decades of actually building the technology, he's settled on 2048-2050 for the singularity. The reason for the delay? Turns out making robots that can physically manipulate the real world is way harder than making neural networks that can recognize cats or generate text. While software AI has progressed at breakneck speed, getting a robot to reliably install plumbing or assemble complex machinery remains frustratingly difficult. Schmidhuber's revised timeline acknowledges what many AI researchers quietly admit: intelligence without embodiment is only half the equation for true transformative AI. You can have the smartest AI in the world, but if it can't physically build more of itself or construct the infrastructure for autonomous operation, you don't get a singularity—you get a very impressive chatbot. It's a sobering reminder that even the optimists are learning to respect the challenges of the physical world.","criteria_definition":"Singularity requires both advanced AI and physical robotics capable of autonomous real-world manipulation and construction.","confidence_level":"Low to medium confidence, significantly revised from earlier predictions in the 1970s","source_name":"AI pioneer interviews 2018-2025","source_url":"https://longtermrisk.org/against-gdp-as-a-metric-for-ai-timelines-and-takeoff-speeds/","concept_keys":["event-horizon"]}
