{"tldr_summary":"The AGI race has moved from conference rooms to trading floors. On Kalshi and Polymarket, weekly trading volume for AI-related contracts hit $6 billion as of February 2026, with the 'When will OpenAI achieve AGI?' contract attracting the most attention. The 'Before 2030' probability sits at 42%, up from 32% six months earlier, while 'Before 2027' remains at a modest 14%. What makes this significant is the resolution criteria's strictness—contracts rely on official OpenAI announcements, independent third-party audits, and the trigger of the 'AGI clause' in the OpenAI-Microsoft partnership agreement. The market has bifurcated into 'Weak AGI' (passing a comprehensive multi-modal Turing Test) and 'Full AGI' (matching OpenAI's internal definition), acknowledging that different definitions yield wildly different timelines. The liquidity is crucial—$6 billion in weekly volume ensures prices aren't easily manipulated and instead reflect a 'wisdom of crowds' that includes people who actually build this technology. The steady climb in probability represents growing consensus that technical hurdles are being cleared faster than critics anticipated. Unlike corporate press releases designed to attract investment or academic papers designed to attract citations, these markets reward accuracy with profit and punish hype with losses. It's capitalism's way of asking: what do you really believe?","criteria_definition":"Bifurcated between 'Weak AGI' (comprehensive multi-modal Turing Test) and 'Full AGI' (OpenAI's internal definition).","confidence_level":"42% probability represents aggregate market confidence from engineers, VCs, and policy experts","source_name":"Kalshi prediction exchange","source_url":"https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/predictstreet-2026-2-9-the-race-to-singularity-why-kalshi-traders-are-betting-big-on-openai-achieving-agi-before-2030","concept_keys":["agi","turing-test"]}
