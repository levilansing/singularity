{"tldr_summary":"In a bombshell 1970 Life Magazine interview about Shakey the robot, Marvin Minsky declared that within 3-8 years we'd have machines matching average human intelligence across every domain from Shakespeare to car maintenance. The kicker? Once achieved, these machines would self-educate to genius level 'in a few months.' He added the now-famous warning: 'If we're lucky, they might decide to keep us as pets.' When 1975 arrived without AGI, AI funding evaporated and the field entered its first brutal 'winter.' Minsky later claimed journalist Brad Darrach 'made up' the quote, though the retraction came suspiciously late. This prediction became Exhibit A in the case against AI hype—at least until the 2020s rolled around and everyone forgot the lesson.","criteria_definition":"Machine with general intelligence of average human, capable of reading Shakespeare, greasing cars, playing office politics, and telling jokes","confidence_level":"Extremely confident, predicting machines would read Shakespeare, grease cars, and play office politics within 3-8 years, then reach genius level in months","source_name":"Life Magazine interview (1970)","source_url":"https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kuipers/opinions/AI-progress.html","concept_keys":["agi"]}
