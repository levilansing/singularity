{"tldr_summary":"Yoshua Bengio, Turing Award winner and deep learning pioneer, compressed his superintelligence timeline from decades or centuries down to 5-20 years with 95% confidence after watching GPT-4 and friends. This represents one of the most dramatic timeline revisions from a founding father of modern AI. Bengio's pivot from dismissing AI risk to leading safety research and radically shortening estimates shows how ChatGPT scrambled even the experts' priors. His warning: once AGI emerges, superintelligence could follow within months through recursive self-improvement, not years. The man who helped create deep learning now spends his time warning about its potential to kill everyone, which should probably concern us. His 95% confidence interval spanning 2028-2043 captures genuine uncertainty about exact timing while maintaining alarm about the narrow window. When the person who literally invented the technology says we might have 5 years, that's not doomerism - that's the engineer reading the blueprints.","criteria_definition":"Superhuman intelligence emergence; 95% confidence interval 5-20 years post-ChatGPT","confidence_level":"95% confidence within 5-20 years; shortened from decades or centuries","source_name":"FAQ on Catastrophic AI Risks - yoshuabengio.org (2023)","source_url":"https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/06/24/faq-on-catastrophic-ai-risks/","concept_keys":["superintelligence","recursive-self-improvement","alignment","industry-academia-divergence"]}
