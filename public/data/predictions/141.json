{"tldr_summary":"Open Philanthropy researcher Tom Davidson developed a sophisticated probabilistic framework for AGI timelines, landing on a median estimate of 2050 (30 years from the 2020 baseline). The approach uses 'semi-informative priors'—a Bayesian method that updates beliefs about AGI arrival based on observed failures to achieve it, anchored to biological compute requirements. Unlike simple extrapolation, this framework explicitly models uncertainty about how many 'trials' humanity gets and what constitutes a meaningful attempt. The methodology became influential in EA circles for its mathematical rigor, though critics note it's still fundamentally limited by assumptions about what AGI requires and whether past AI research truly counts as failed attempts at the real thing.","criteria_definition":"AGI defined via biological anchors framework using compute requirements and training efficiency milestones","confidence_level":"Semi-informative priors framework with explicit uncertainty bounds and sensitivity analysis across multiple input parameters","source_name":"Open Philanthropy AI timelines research","source_url":"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/semi-informative-priors-over-ai-timelines/","concept_keys":["agi","biological-anchors"]}
