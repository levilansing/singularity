{"tldr_summary":"In an April 2024 interview with Norway's sovereign wealth fund CEO—one of Tesla's largest shareholders managing $1.6 trillion—Elon Musk casually predicted AGI would arrive 'probably next year, within two years.' The conversation covered Tesla's Swedish labor disputes and Chinese EV competition, but Musk's AGI timeline dropped like a bombshell: artificial general intelligence smarter than the smartest human by 2025 or 2026. He blamed chip shortages and electricity constraints for any potential delays, noting Grok 2 needed 20,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs while Grok 3 would require 100,000. The boldness of predicting AGI within 8-20 months to a major institutional investor showcased either extraordinary conviction or extraordinary optimism—possibly both. Musk's willingness to state such aggressive timelines without hedging to sophisticated financial stakeholders suggests he genuinely believes xAI and competitors are on the cusp, even if his historical timeline accuracy suggests adding 2-3 years to any Musk prediction yields better calibration.","criteria_definition":"AI smarter than the smartest human across general intelligence domains","confidence_level":"Direct statement to major institutional investor without probabilistic hedging","source_name":"Interview with Norway sovereign wealth fund CEO (April 2024)","source_url":"https://www.business-standard.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-says-ai-will-gain-general-intelligence-outsmart-humans-by-2025-124040900177_1.html","concept_keys":["agi","economic-singularity","industry-academia-divergence"]}
