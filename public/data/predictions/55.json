{"tldr_summary":"John von Neumann, the polymath who helped build the atomic bomb and pioneered computer architecture, quietly introduced the concept of technological 'singularity' in conversations during the 1950s. In discussions with mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, von Neumann described 'ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.' Von Neumann borrowed the term from physics—where singularities mark points where normal rules break down—to describe a future where technological change becomes so rapid that human civilization reaches an event horizon. He never lived to see computers smaller than refrigerators, dying in 1957 at age 53, but his metaphor captured something profound about exponential technological acceleration. The term lay dormant for decades until Vernor Vinge revived it in the 1980s and Ray Kurzweil popularized it in the 2000s, but von Neumann saw the storm approaching from the very dawn of the computer age.","criteria_definition":"Point where accelerating technological progress becomes so rapid that human affairs reach a singularity beyond which continuation as we know it becomes impossible","confidence_level":"Philosophical certainty about approaching singularity without specific timeline, describing it as inevitable technological acceleration","source_name":"Ulam tribute in Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society (1958)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity","concept_keys":["event-horizon","accelerating-change"]}
