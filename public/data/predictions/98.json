{"tldr_summary":"In a prediction so bold it could be a LinkedIn post, Geoffrey Hinton forecasts that AI will improve in 2026 and replace jobs. Specifically, he notes AI's 7-month doubling pattern: tasks that took an hour now take minutes, and this compounds rapidly. Within a few years, month-long software projects will take days, decimating demand for engineers. The prediction is less interesting for its content than for who's saying it: the godfather of AI matter-of-factly describing job displacement as inevitable near-term reality, not distant speculation. Hinton's also 'more worried' than when he left Google, noting AI is getting better at reasoning and deception. The 2026 timeline isn't about AGI or superintelligence—it's about AI becoming good enough to automate knowledge work at scale. It's the kind of incremental-but-transformative prediction that's simultaneously obvious and terrifying, depending on whether you're an AI company executive or someone whose job involves writing code.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI in 2026 specifically for job displacement and task automation capabilities","confidence_level":"High confidence based on observed 7-month doubling pattern in AI capabilities","source_name":"Fortune December 2025","source_url":"https://fortune.com/2025/12/28/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-2026-prediction-human-worker-replacement/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis"]}
