{"tldr_summary":"In what might be the fastest timeline collapse in forecasting history, Metaculus community predictions for AGI have plummeted from 'around 2072' in 2022 to '50% by 2033' in early 2026—a 45-year acceleration in just four years. The shift reflects post-GPT-4 recalibration across the entire forecasting community as capabilities that seemed decades away suddenly materialized. The current distribution shows 25% probability by 2029 and 50% by 2033, with uncertainty spanning 2029 to 2040. This represents thousands of individual forecasters updating their beliefs as scaling laws continued delivering, multimodal models emerged, and reasoning capabilities improved faster than almost anyone predicted. The dramatic compression raises a meta-question: are forecasters finally calibrated to AI's exponential trajectory, or are they overcorrecting after being burned by conservative predictions? Either way, the consensus has shifted from 'our grandchildren's problem' to 'current college students might see this before they retire.' The 80,000 Hours analysis tracking these shifts notes this represents one of the most significant belief updates in the effective altruism and forecasting communities.","criteria_definition":"Artificial general intelligence matching human cognitive abilities across broad domains","confidence_level":"Community median shifted 45 years in 4 years; 25% probability by 2029, 50% by 2033","source_name":"Metaculus Feb 2026","source_url":"https://80000hours.org/2025/03/when-do-experts-expect-agi-to-arrive/","concept_keys":["agi","accelerating-change","scaling-hypothesis"]}
