{"tldr_summary":"In a delightfully cynical survey result, Pew Research Center found that 68% of AI experts predict ethical principles will NOT be employed in most AI systems by 2030. Let that sink in: the people who actually understand AI development don't believe the industry will implement its own stated ethical guidelines. This isn't about capability—it's about incentives. The survey captures expert pessimism about whether competitive pressures, regulatory capture, and economic incentives will allow meaningful ethics implementation even as AI capabilities explode. It's the rare prediction that's both depressing and completely plausible. The experts aren't saying ethical AI is impossible; they're saying the industry probably won't bother even trying in most cases. If you're wondering why AI safety researchers seem perpetually stressed, this survey result is Exhibit A.","criteria_definition":"Deployment of ethical principles and safety guidelines in production AI systems by 2030","confidence_level":"68% expert consensus from broad survey of AI researchers and ethicists","source_name":"Pew Research Center expert survey","source_url":"https://www.pewresearch.org/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","economic-singularity","alignment"]}
