{"tldr_summary":"By August 2025, Geoffrey Hinton had refined his warnings with actual probability estimates: 10-20% chance of human extinction from AI, up from his earlier 10% figure. This isn't some random blogger's hot take—this is a Nobel Prize winner in Physics (awarded for his AI work) calmly stating there's a one-in-five chance his field's breakthroughs end humanity. Hinton's willingness to attach specific numbers to existential risk, and his continued escalation of concern despite inevitable backlash, lends extraordinary gravity to warnings many dismiss as science fiction panic. He's explicit about the mechanism: once AI becomes smarter than humans, controlling it becomes fundamentally impossible, especially if bad actors weaponize it. The 10-20% range puts AI extinction risk higher than nuclear war estimates and vastly higher than asteroid impacts. If Hinton is even partially correct, this makes AI the single greatest threat humanity faces.","criteria_definition":"Superintelligence with explicit extinction risk quantification of 10-20% probability","confidence_level":"10-20% probability of human extinction; increased from earlier 10% estimate","source_name":"CNN Business reporting on Ai4 conference Las Vegas (August 2025)","source_url":"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/13/tech/ai-geoffrey-hinton","concept_keys":["superintelligence","industry-academia-divergence"]}
