{"tldr_summary":"Katja Grace's 2022 survey of 352 machine learning researchers produced a median AGI estimate of 2061—a comfortable 39 years away that let everyone sleep soundly. The prediction represented the field's pre-ChatGPT consensus: AGI was coming, sure, but not in our lifetimes, probably not in our children's lifetimes, maybe our grandchildren would deal with it. Fast forward to 2023, and Grace's follow-up survey of 2,778 researchers slashed that median to 2047, a 13-year leap in just one year. By 2024-2025, individual predictions clustered around 2027-2035, with some going full \"AGI by 2027\" panic mode. The 2022 survey now reads like a historical artifact from a more innocent time, when the field believed scaling laws would plateau, when nobody had seen what GPT-4 could do, when \"AI safety\" was a niche concern rather than a White House priority. The whiplash from 2061 to \"maybe next year\" represents one of the fastest expert consensus shifts in scientific history.","criteria_definition":"Human-level machine intelligence across all cognitive domains","confidence_level":"50% confidence at median; represents pre-ChatGPT baseline before field-wide timeline acceleration","source_name":"Grace et al.
