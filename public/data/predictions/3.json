{"tldr_summary":"Published October 22, 2025 by AI Frontiers (authors Adam Khoja, Laura Hiscott, and Dan Hendrycks from Center for AI Safety), this report built a real AGI report card using 10 cognitive abilities from Cattell-Horn-Carroll intelligence theory. Current scores: GPT-4 at 27% and GPT-5 at 57%, with improvements mainly from bigger context windows and better multimodal support. The brutal finding: continual learning (long-term memory storage) scores absolute zero across all models and requires a major breakthrough, not just engineering. Other bottlenecks include visual reasoning, hallucinations, and spatial navigation. One author estimates 50% odds of hitting their 95% AGI threshold by end of 2028 and 80% by 2030, which seems optimistic given current models just barely reached passing grades. The article notes most gaps are tractable with business-as-usual research except that pesky memory problem.","criteria_definition":"AGI Score 95%+ across 10 cognitive abilities (knowledge, reasoning, memory, visual/auditory processing) via Cattell-Horn-Carroll framework","confidence_level":"50% by end of 2028, 80% by end of 2030 (one author estimate)","source_name":"AI Frontiers - AGIs Last Bottlenecks","source_url":"https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/agis-last-bottlenecks","concept_keys":["agi","alignment","survey-drift"]}
