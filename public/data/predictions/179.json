{"tldr_summary":"Yoshua Bengio, one of the three 'godfathers of AI' who won the Turing Award for deep learning breakthroughs, has dramatically shortened his AGI timeline and now estimates 5-20 years with high confidence—a striking shift from his earlier 'decades away' stance. Writing for the Aspen Strategy Group on national security implications, Bengio notes that over 20% of Metaculus predictors now estimate AGI before 2027, consistent with steady algorithmic advances and trillions in R&D investment. What makes his prediction particularly alarming: he emphasizes AI systems capable of advancing AI research itself, which could 'multiply the advanced research workforce by orders of magnitude.' Once an AI matches the capability of top researchers, it can be deployed in parallel across hundreds of thousands of instances, potentially triggering recursive self-improvement. Bengio warns that superintelligence could emerge 'months' after AGI through this self-improvement loop—a compressed timeline that makes alignment work desperately urgent. His shift from skeptic to concerned predictor carries weight: this isn't a Silicon Valley hype man, but a researcher who spent decades building the foundations that made modern AI possible, now warning that his own creations might arrive faster and more dangerously than anyone expected.","criteria_definition":"AGI defined as human-level capabilities across broad spectrum of cognitive skills, with particular emphasis on AI systems capable of advancing AI research itself, potentially leading to rapid recursive self-improvement","confidence_level":"High confidence with over 20% of Metaculus predictors estimating AGI before 2027, citing steady algorithmic progress and exponential R&D investment growth","source_name":"Multiple 2024-2025 interviews","source_url":"https://yoshuabengio.org/2024/10/30/implications-of-artificial-general-intelligence-on-national-and-international-security/","concept_keys":["agi","recursive-self-improvement","accelerating-change","alignment"]}
