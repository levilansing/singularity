{"tldr_summary":"While dismissing AGI hype as a distraction, Satya Nadella made a specific prediction for 2026: this will be the year AI stops being a science project and starts being genuinely useful in daily work. Not AGI, not superintelligence, just AI that actually helps people get things done. In a January 2026 blog post, Nadella argued the industry has spent years building powerful tools that mostly collect dust because they're too complex or solve the wrong problems. He believes 2026 marks the inflection point where AI becomes as mundane and essential as email—something people use without thinking about it. This is classic Nadella pragmatism: forget the moonshot rhetoric, focus on whether your technology saves someone time on Tuesday afternoon. The prediction doubles as a mission statement for Microsoft's AI strategy: win by making AI boring and useful, not by chasing theoretical milestones.","criteria_definition":"Year when AI transitions from experimental technology to practical everyday tool with measurable productivity impact","confidence_level":"High confidence that 2026 marks practical deployment inflection point for AI utility","source_name":"Microsoft CEO 2026 statements","source_url":"https://www.hackdiversity.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-says-2026/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai"]}
