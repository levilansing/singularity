{"tldr_summary":"Robin Hanson's 2016 book 'The Age of Em' explores a future where researchers achieve whole brain emulation—scanning human brains at cellular resolution and running functional copies on computers—before creating artificial general intelligence from scratch. These 'ems' (emulated people) would quickly outnumber biological humans, creating a radically different economic and social landscape. Hanson predicts this could happen 'sometime in the next century or so,' with brain scanning reaching sufficient resolution in the 2025-2050 timeframe. The scenario is notable for proposing that mind uploading might be easier than building AGI from first principles, since we can copy the architecture that already works (human brains) rather than inventing intelligence from scratch. The book provides extraordinary detail about em society, economics, and culture, applying Hanson's economist perspective to predict how digital labor markets would function. Whether this pathway actually precedes or follows traditional AGI remains hotly debated, but it represents an important alternative timeline for transformative AI.","criteria_definition":"Whole brain emulation at sufficient resolution to create functional digital copies of human minds ('ems')","confidence_level":"Medium confidence based on technological feasibility analysis and extrapolation from neuroscience progress","source_name":"The Age of Em (2016)","source_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Em","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","economic-singularity"]}
