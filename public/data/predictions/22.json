{"tldr_summary":"Holden Karnofsky, who allocates hundreds of millions in AI safety funding at Open Philanthropy, put greater than 10% odds on transformative AI by 2036 and roughly 50% by 2060. Writing this before ChatGPT in his Cold Takes blog series, he argued we're radically unprepared for AI timelines much shorter than conventional wisdom suggested. When someone controlling massive philanthropic capital makes bets like this, it signals something important: the people with money on the line think near-term transformative AI is plausible enough to restructure their entire giving strategy. Karnofsky's framing - transformative as the Industrial Revolution - helps cut through AGI definition debates. We might argue about consciousness and understanding, but Industrial-Revolution-scale economic transformation is pretty unambiguous. His greater than 10% probability for 2036 was aggressive for 2021, before language models made everyone update. The kicker: he wrote this pre-ChatGPT, meaning his timelines were shortened by 2024 trends that came after. Open Philanthropy's funding decisions now assume transformative AI might arrive while current grad students are still mid-career.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI: AI that transforms economy and world as much as Industrial Revolution","confidence_level":"Greater than 10% by 2036, around 50% by 2060","source_name":"Cold Takes blog - Where AI Forecasting Stands Today (2021)","source_url":"https://www.cold-takes.com/where-ai-forecasting-stands-today/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis","economic-singularity","alignment"]}
