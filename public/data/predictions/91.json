{"tldr_summary":"Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO who now runs a massive AI investment firm, is putting his money where his mouth is with a bold 3-5 year AGI timeline. His thesis? We don't need revolutionary breakthroughs—just smart integration of today's reasoning engines, coding assistants, and math solvers. It's the ultimate 'the pieces are all here, just assemble them' argument, conveniently timed with his firm's aggressive AI investments. Schmidt's betting that AGI is an engineering problem, not a research problem, which either makes him a visionary or someone who really, really wants his portfolio companies to look promising. The timeline lands squarely in the 2028-2030 window, meaning we're supposedly just one good integration framework away from machines that can do anything humans can do intellectually.","criteria_definition":"AGI achieved by combining current advances in reasoning, programming, and mathematical capabilities","confidence_level":"High confidence based on integration of existing capabilities in reasoning, programming, and mathematics without requiring new breakthroughs","source_name":"AIMultiple reporting (April 2025)","source_url":"https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/","concept_keys":["agi"]}
