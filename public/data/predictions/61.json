{"tldr_summary":"Ben Goertzel has been the Cassandra of 2029 AGI predictions since 2010, maintaining his forecast through hype cycles and AI winters alike. But at the 2024 Beneficial AGI Summit, the SingularityNET founder surprised everyone by moving his estimate forward to 'possibly as early as 2027.' His range now spans 2027-2032, with 2029 still the sweet spot. Goertzel expects rapid takeoff to artificial superintelligence once AGI threshold is crossed—no gradual transition, just exponential explosion. His decade-plus consistency makes this acceleration noteworthy: when someone who's been saying the same thing for 14 years suddenly speeds up their timeline, either the evidence changed or they're getting impatient. Given recent LLM capabilities, probably the former. The man who literally founded a cryptocurrency-powered decentralized AI network is betting his reputation on a 3-8 year window.","criteria_definition":"AGI as human-level general intelligence across cognitive domains, with rapid takeoff to superintelligence","confidence_level":"High confidence maintained across 14+ years, now accelerating timeline slightly based on recent progress","source_name":"Beneficial AGI Summit Panama City (March 2024)","source_url":"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-agi-singularity-in-2027-artificial-super-intelligence-sooner-than-we-think-ben-goertzel","concept_keys":["agi","soft-takeoff","accelerating-change","industry-academia-divergence"]}
