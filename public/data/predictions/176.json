{"tldr_summary":"Yann LeCun dropped a bomb at Davos, declaring that large language models have a 'shelf life of three to five years' and predicting 'nobody in their right mind' will use them as central AI components by 2030. The Meta chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner isn't predicting AGI—he's predicting something potentially more practical: 'world models' that actually understand physical reality, maintain persistent memory, reason effectively, and plan complex actions. Current LLMs, he argues, are fundamentally limited by four critical gaps: no understanding of the physical world, no persistent memory, no real reasoning, and no complex planning. These aren't bugs to be fixed with more scale—they're architectural limitations requiring a complete paradigm shift. LeCun is putting his money where his mouth is: he's reportedly launching a world models startup seeking a $5B+ valuation, possibly leaving Meta to do it. His timeline suggests 2028-2030 as the inflection point when the new paradigm emerges, followed by a 'decade of robotics' as embodied AI finally works in the real world. If he's right, everyone betting on scaled-up LLMs is about to look very silly.","criteria_definition":"New AI paradigm based on world models enabling physical understanding, persistent memory, reasoning, and complex planning—fundamentally different architecture from current LLMs","confidence_level":"Very high confidence in paradigm shift, with LeCun stating 'nobody in their right mind would use them anymore' about current LLMs within five years","source_name":"TechCrunch January 2025","source_url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/metas-yann-lecun-predicts-a-new-ai-architectures-paradigm-within-5-years-and-decade-of-robotics/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis"]}
