{"tldr_summary":"Patrick Winston, who directed MIT's legendary AI Lab for decades, gave 2040 as his best guess for AGI while openly admitting the prediction was extraordinarily difficult. Winston's 2014 estimate (range 2035-2045) represented old-guard AI thinking—the pre-deep-learning consensus that AGI remained safely 25+ years away. Winston, who passed away in 2019, spent his career teaching MIT students that AI required understanding human cognition, not just throwing compute at problems. His cautious timeline reflected someone who'd watched multiple AI springs and winters, who'd seen grand promises crash against reality's rocks. The narrow 10-year range around 2040 suggests more precision than his actual confidence warranted—this was an elder statesman being pressed for a number when he knew the field's track record on predictions was abysmal. His reluctance to commit stands in stark contrast to the confident near-term predictions that would dominate the post-GPT era.","criteria_definition":"Artificial General Intelligence capable of performing cognitive tasks at human level","confidence_level":"Acknowledged difficulty in estimation, described as 'tough to estimate'","source_name":"AIMultiple analysis","source_url":"https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/","concept_keys":["agi"]}
