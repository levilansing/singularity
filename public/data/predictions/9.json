{"tldr_summary":"Published in his 2024 book The Singularity Is Nearer, Ray Kurzweil maintains his signature 2029 AGI prediction made way back in 1999. Now 76, Google's director of engineering insists human-level AI arrives when technology hits a trillion calculations per second - which he pegs to 2029. His track record on narrow predictions (smartphone ubiquity, computer vision progress) lends credibility, though critics note his timeline hasn't budged despite decades of shifting AI landscapes. Kurzweil's methodology relies on his Law of Accelerating Returns: exponential compute trends make AGI inevitable by 2029. In TED talks and interviews promoting the book, he says he's sticking with his five years prediction. The man who correctly forecast the death of the Soviet Union and rise of the internet now promises AGI arrives on schedule regardless of setbacks, skeptics, or AI winters. His refusal to adjust the date is either prophetic conviction or stubborn commitment to a 25-year-old guess.","criteria_definition":"AGI: machines passing Turing test; computational power reaching threshold of human brain (trillion operations/sec)","confidence_level":"High (refusing to budge since 1999)","source_name":"The Singularity Is Nearer book and TED Talk (2024)","source_url":"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a70171717/2045-singularity-ray-kurzweil-predictions/","concept_keys":["agi","accelerating-change","turing-test","industry-academia-divergence"]}
