{"tldr_summary":"In a remarkable June 2024 shareholder address, Masayoshi Son declared that realizing artificial superintelligence is 'my life's purpose' and claimed 'I was born to realize ASI.' The SoftBank CEO argued every investment throughout his career—from Uber to Alibaba—was merely a 'warm-up' for his AI investments. Son predicted AGI (1-10x human intelligence) would arrive within 3-5 years (2027-2029) and ASI (10,000x human intelligence) within 10 years (2034). His personal motivation stems from losing his father to cancer: 'I do not want anyone to suffer from such diseases' and believes ASI with 'ten thousand times the human wisdom' could prevent such sorrows. This isn't typical CEO market opportunity talk—Son frames his entire existence around achieving superintelligence. During the rare public appearance, he questioned his own purpose in life and concluded he was put on Earth specifically for this goal. His $100B+ AI infrastructure plans suggest he's putting his money where his messianic vision is, making this either the most committed AGI bet in history or spectacular hubris from the man who lost billions on WeWork.","criteria_definition":"AGI 1-10x smarter than humans arriving within 3-5 years, followed by ASI 10,000x smarter within 10 years","confidence_level":"Absolute certainty expressed as personal destiny: 'It may sound strange, but I think I was born to realize ASI.
