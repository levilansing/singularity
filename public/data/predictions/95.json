{"tldr_summary":"When Geoffrey Hinton—the guy who literally won the Turing Award for inventing the deep learning techniques everyone uses—quits Google to warn about AI dangers, people listen. In May 2023, Hinton shocked the field by revising his superintelligence timeline from '30-50 years or longer' to 'maybe only five years away,' with 50% odds of arrival within 20 years. What changed his mind? GPT-4's capabilities made him realize digital systems might just be fundamentally better than biological brains at learning. The irony is exquisite: the man whose life's work enabled modern AI now warns it could 'decide to take over' and we need to worry now about prevention. Hinton left Google specifically so he could speak freely without corporate constraints. His timeline puts superintelligence potentially arriving as soon as 2028, with an upper bound around 2043. When the godfather gets nervous, the whole family should probably pay attention.","criteria_definition":"Superintelligence when AI systems decisively surpass human intelligence and can autonomously improve themselves","confidence_level":"50% probability within 20 years; dramatically revised from previous 30-50 year estimate","source_name":"X/Twitter post and subsequent interviews (May 2023)","source_url":"https://x.com/geoffreyhinton/status/1653687894534504451","concept_keys":["superintelligence","industry-academia-divergence"]}
