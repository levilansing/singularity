{"tldr_summary":"In the same September 2025 podcast appearance, Roman Yampolskiy painted a picture of 2030 where humanoid robots finally crack the dexterity problem—the last major barrier to full physical automation. He specifically called out plumbers as an example of jobs requiring fine motor control that will fall once robots achieve human-level flexibility. The prediction hinges on AGI arriving in 2027 (per prediction markets and AI labs) then getting embodied in increasingly capable robots over the next three years. Yampolskiy argues this dexterity threshold is crucial because manual labor—construction, caregiving, skilled trades—has resisted automation specifically due to the complexity of human hands and spatial reasoning. Once solved, he expects rapid acceleration toward his 99% unemployment scenario. The timeline assumes no major technical roadblocks and continued exponential progress in robotics, which critics note is far from guaranteed. Still, it's a more concrete prediction than most AI safety researchers offer about physical automation timelines.","criteria_definition":"Humanoid robots achieving human-level dexterity and flexibility to compete across all physical labor domains including skilled trades","confidence_level":"High confidence with specific timeline of 5 years from 2025 for humanoid robot dexterity breakthrough","source_name":"AI Safety Warning 2025","source_url":"https://www.stork.ai/blog/ais-top-scientist-issues-a-final-warning","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","accelerating-change","economic-singularity","alignment"]}
