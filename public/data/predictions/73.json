{"tldr_summary":"While Dario Amodei promised Nobel-level AI by 2027 and Sam Altman claimed we're \"slipping past AGI\" already, Demis Hassabis brought actual scientific rigor to Davos 2026. The Nobel laureate and DeepMind CEO gave 50% probability to AGI \"within the decade,\" emphasizing current systems are \"nowhere near\" human-level intelligence and require \"one or two more breakthroughs\" comparable to Transformers or AlphaGo. His measured stance contrasts sharply with Anthropic and OpenAI's certainty, creating an unusual spectacle: AI luminaries publicly disagreeing on whether humanity's most significant technological threshold arrives in 18 months or 5+ years. Hassabis identified key gaps including few-shot learning and continuous learning capabilities. When the guy who built AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and Gemini says we need fundamental breakthroughs—not just more compute—it's worth listening. He's the only CEO at Davos whose predictions come with actual Nobel Prize credentials in the relevant field.","criteria_definition":"Human-level artificial general intelligence requiring fundamental architectural breakthroughs beyond current LLM scaling","confidence_level":"50% probability within the decade, acknowledging 'one or two more breakthroughs' needed beyond current techniques","source_name":"World Economic Forum Davos (January 2026)","source_url":"https://fortune.com/2026/01/23/deepmind-demis-hassabis-anthropic-dario-amodei-yann-lecun-ai-davos/","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","industry-academia-divergence"]}
