{"tldr_summary":"Epoch AI's comprehensive literature review of transformative AI timelines reveals a striking 20-year spread across credible models, ranging from optimistic 'direct approach' estimates around 2027 to conservative 'biological anchors' projections beyond 2047. The research organization analyzed both 'inside view' models (based on specific technical pathways like compute requirements) and 'outside view' models (based on historical precedents and reference classes), finding that inside-view approaches generally predict shorter timelines while outside-view models push dates further out. The team found Ajeya Cotra's 'biological anchors' framework most compelling for inside-view modeling (median 2052) and Tom Davidson's 'semi-informative priors' best for outside-view (median beyond 2100), though judgment-based forecasts from expert teams like Samotsvety skewed more aggressive (median 2043). The wide range reflects genuine uncertainty about key parameters: compute efficiency improvements, algorithmic breakthroughs, and whether current deep learning paradigms can scale to AGI or require fundamental innovations. Epoch AI's meta-analysis doesn't endorse a single timeline but maps the landscape of credible predictions, showing that expert disagreement spans decades—a humbling reminder that despite rapid AI progress, predicting transformative AI remains extraordinarily difficult.","criteria_definition":"Transformative AI capable of precipitating transition comparable to agricultural or industrial revolution","confidence_level":"Meta-analysis presenting range of models with different assumptions, not single point estimate","source_name":"Epoch AI research 2024","source_url":"https://epoch.ai/blog/literature-review-of-transformative-artificial-intelligence-timelines","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","biological-anchors"]}
