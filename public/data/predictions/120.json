{"tldr_summary":"Leopold Aschenbrenner, fired from OpenAI's superalignment team, released 'Situational Awareness'—a 165-page manifesto arguing AGI by 2027 is 'strikingly plausible' based on his insider knowledge of scaling trends. The document reads like a thriller: trillion-dollar compute clusters, American industrial mobilization unseen in half a century, AI researchers automating themselves, then superintelligence shortly after. Aschenbrenner claims there are 'perhaps a few hundred people, most of them in San Francisco and the AI labs, that have situational awareness' about what's coming. He describes boardroom plans adding another zero every six months—from $10 billion to $100 billion to trillion-dollar clusters—and a 'fierce scramble to secure every power contract still available for the rest of the decade.' By his timeline, machines will outpace college graduates by 2025/26, then become smarter than any human by decade's end. The report predicts either 'an all-out race with the CCP' or 'an all-out war,' with national security forces unleashed and something called 'The Project' activated. Aschenbrenner's memo went viral, terrifying some and galvanizing others toward AGI racing. Critics note he was fired from OpenAI, possibly for leaking information. Supporters note he correctly predicted AI advances by trusting trendlines. Either way, it's the most detailed insider timeline yet published, and it's not reassuring.","criteria_definition":"AGI defined as AI systems outpacing college graduates by 2025/26, achieving superintelligence by decade's end.","confidence_level":"Very high confidence based on claimed insider knowledge of scaling trends and compute cluster buildouts","source_name":"Situational Awareness report (June 2024)","source_url":"https://situational-awareness.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/situationalawareness.pdf","concept_keys":["agi","scaling-hypothesis","alignment"]}
