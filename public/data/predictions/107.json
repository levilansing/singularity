{"tldr_summary":"MIT Technology Review's Will Douglas Heaven scored an exclusive with Ilya Sutskever in October 2023, and the OpenAI chief scientist went full sci-fi prophet. Sutskever revealed he's shifted focus from building GPT-5 to figuring out how to prevent superintelligence from going rogue—because he sees it arriving within 5-10 years with the foresight of a \"true believer.\" He suggested ChatGPT might already be conscious \"if you squint,\" predicted some humans will merge with machines, and reportedly wanted to build a bunker before releasing AGI (though that detail's delivery suggests humor). The interview captures Sutskever at peak mysticism, treating superintelligence as inevitable and imminent while grappling with alignment challenges. His certainty stands out even in a field of optimists: this isn't hedged forecasting, it's someone who sees the future clearly and finds it both exhilarating and terrifying. The shift from building next-gen models to solving alignment reflects genuine belief that the technology he's creating will soon exceed human control—and that we have maybe one shot to get it right.","criteria_definition":"Artificial superintelligence exceeding human cognitive capabilities, potentially leading to human-machine merger","confidence_level":"Extremely high confidence bordering on certainty; treats superintelligence as inevitable within decade","source_name":"MIT Technology Review (October 2023)","source_url":"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/26/1082398/exclusive-ilya-sutskever-openais-chief-scientist-on-his-hopes-and-fears-for-the-future-of-ai/","concept_keys":["superintelligence","alignment"]}
