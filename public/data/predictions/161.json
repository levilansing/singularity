{"tldr_summary":"Samotsvety, a superforecasting collective known for winning prediction markets rather than building AI, delivered their professional estimate: 28% probability of AGI by 2030, 50% by 2041, and a long tail stretching to 2100. Unlike researchers who might have institutional incentives to hype or downplay timelines, these are people who literally bet money on being right. Their relatively aggressive timeline (compared to pre-ChatGPT surveys) reflects how even professional skeptics recalibrated after large language models surprised everyone. The 72-year span between their 10th and 90th percentile estimates captures genuine uncertainty about whether this happens in 5 years or requires fundamental breakthroughs we haven't imagined yet.","criteria_definition":"System capable of passing adversarial Turing test against top-5% human with expert access","confidence_level":"Aggregate forecast from multiple superforecasters with established track records on prediction markets; 50% confidence interval spans 2035-2047","source_name":"EA Forum - Samotsvety AGI Timelines","source_url":"https://80000hours.org/2025/03/when-do-experts-expect-agi-to-arrive/","concept_keys":["agi","turing-test","survey-drift"]}
