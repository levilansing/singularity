{"tldr_summary":"Ray Kurzweil's 2045 singularity prediction remains unchanged from his 2005 book: human brains will merge with AI through nanobots inserted into capillaries, creating brain-machine interfaces that multiply intelligence a millionfold. We'll be a combination of our natural intelligence and our cybernetic intelligence, all rolled into one, he promises. The Singularity Is Nearer (2024) reaffirms every detail of his original vision - nanobots, immortality through medical nanotech, transcendence of biological limits. Critics call it science fiction; Kurzweil calls it extrapolation. His 2045 date represents Epoch 5 in his framework where machine intelligence becomes infinitely more powerful than all human intelligence combined. The pitch hasn't changed in 20 years, just the distance to the goalpost. Whether Kurzweil lives to see his merger (he'd be 97) depends on whether his anti-aging protocols work as advertised.","criteria_definition":"Singularity: human-AI merger via brain nanobots; millionfold intelligence expansion; Epoch 5","confidence_level":"Certain (predicting since 2005)","source_name":"The Singularity Is Nearer book and Science Friday interview (2024)","source_url":"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a70171717/2045-singularity-ray-kurzweil-predictions/","concept_keys":["event-horizon","industry-academia-divergence"]}
