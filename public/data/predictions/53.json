{"tldr_summary":"I.J. Good, the British mathematician who cracked Nazi codes alongside Alan Turing at Bletchley Park, articulated the most chilling vision of AI's endgame in his 1965 essay. He imagined an 'ultraintelligent machine' that could design even better machines in an endless recursive loop—each generation smarter than the last, accelerating beyond human comprehension. Good called this the 'intelligence explosion' and declared it would be 'the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.' That final caveat—'provided that'—carries all the weight. Good's framework became the foundational text for modern AI safety research, describing precisely the recursive self-improvement scenario that terrifies researchers today. He never specified exact timelines, but suggested the first ultraintelligent machine could arrive anytime from 1965 to 2000, after which human affairs 'could not continue' as we know them.","criteria_definition":"Ultraintelligent machine capable of designing better machines in recursive feedback loop, triggering intelligence explosion beyond human control","confidence_level":"Stated as inevitable consequence of first ultraintelligent machine, with certainty about recursive self-improvement triggering intelligence explosion","source_name":"Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine - Advances in Computers vol. 6","source_url":"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2022/01/04/ultraintelligent/","concept_keys":["event-horizon","recursive-self-improvement","intelligence-explosion","accelerating-change","alignment"]}
