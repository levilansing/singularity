{"tldr_summary":"Shane Legg, who literally coined the term 'artificial general intelligence' and co-founded DeepMind with Demis Hassabis in 2010, put even money on AGI arriving by 2028—and he made that prediction back in 2011. His definition is crisp: an AI system that can reliably handle the full range of human cognitive tasks, not just excel at narrow domains. Legg's timeline (50% by 2028, range 2025-2035) was remarkably aggressive for its era, when most experts were hedging toward mid-century. Google acquired DeepMind for over $500 million in 2014, and the lab's AlphaGo victory over world champion Lee Sedol in 2016 proved machines could master tasks once thought to require human intuition. In a 2023 interview, Legg reaffirmed his 2028 prediction, noting that current LLMs show flashes of general capability but suffer from 'senior moments'—episodic memory failures that prevent true AGI. If he's right, we're now inside his prediction window. If he's wrong, he'll join the long list of AI pioneers whose optimistic timelines collided with reality's complexity.","criteria_definition":"AGI capable of reliably performing the full range of human cognitive tasks","confidence_level":"50% probability assigned to specific year, maintained consistently over time","source_name":"Multiple interviews and 2008 PhD thesis Machine Super Intelligence","source_url":"https://edrm.net/2023/11/shane-leggs-vision-agi-is-likely-by-2028-as-soon-as-we-overcome-ais-senior-moments/","concept_keys":["agi","industry-academia-divergence"]}
