{"tldr_summary":"Metaculus, the prediction platform where accuracy actually matters to your reputation, shows its 1,700-strong forecasting community putting 'weakly general AI' at October 2027—just two years away. This isn't the full human-replacement package, but rather a single system that can match humans across diverse tasks without needing specialized training for each domain. The platform distinguishes this from 'strong AGI' (which requires passing adversarial Turing tests, 90%+ on all academic benchmarks, and embodied robotics). What's stunning is the timeline collapse: just four years ago, the median sat around 2072. That's a 45-year acceleration driven by GPT-4, Claude, and the post-2022 capabilities explosion. The wide uncertainty range—spanning 2026 to 2030—reveals deep disagreement about whether we're one breakthrough away or facing fundamental obstacles. Metaculus forecasters include AI researchers, effective altruism community members, and serious prediction nerds who track their calibration obsessively. Their aggressive timeline reflects the community's post-ChatGPT recalibration from 'decades away' to 'maybe next election cycle.'","criteria_definition":"Single AI system matching human performance across diverse cognitive tasks without specialized training per domain","confidence_level":"1,700+ forecasters with demonstrated track records; median has shifted 45 years earlier in just 4 years","source_name":"Metaculus (~1700 forecasters)","source_url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/","concept_keys":["agi","turing-test","prediction-markets"]}
