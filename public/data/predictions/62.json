{"tldr_summary":"Chris Hay, IBM's Distinguished Engineer, sees 2026 as the year AI agents finally learn to play nice with each other through 'agent control planes' and multi-agent dashboards. Think less 'ChatGPT does one thing' and more 'orchestrated swarm of specialized AIs that don't step on each other's digital toes.' Hay draws parallels to music production, predicting everyone becomes an 'AI composer'—marketers, programmers, project managers all conducting their own agent symphonies. The prediction comes from IBM's annual tech forecast where a dozen experts agreed 2026 won't slow down the crazy train. While DeepSeek and Claude were making headlines with reasoning models, Hay was focused on the infrastructure layer: how do you actually manage dozens of agents without descending into chaos? His answer: control planes, the air traffic control for AI. It's less sexy than AGI predictions but probably more immediately relevant to anyone running a business.","criteria_definition":"Emergence of 'super agents' with control planes and multi-agent orchestration dashboards for enterprise deployment","confidence_level":"Medium confidence based on observed enterprise adoption patterns and infrastructure development","source_name":"IBM 2026 AI trends","source_url":"https://www.ibm.com/think/news/ai-tech-trends-predictions-2026/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai"]}
