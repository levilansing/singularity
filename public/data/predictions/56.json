{"tldr_summary":"A comprehensive meta-analysis of 9,300 predictions from AI researchers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and prediction market participants reveals median AGI expectations clustering around 2040—but with a striking pattern of acceleration. The analysis combined 8 peer-reviewed surveys of 2,778 AI researchers with over 1,100 predictions from markets like Manifold, Kalshi, and Polymarket, plus forecasts from 15 leading AI experts. The data shows survey respondents increasingly expecting AGI earlier than previous estimates, with the timeline compressing as capabilities advance. While OpenAI's Dario Amodei expects near-term AGI due to 'rapid self-reinforcing progress,' DeepMind's Demis Hassabis remains cautious about unresolved challenges in scientific creativity and autonomous self-improvement. The 2040 median sits roughly 15 years more conservative than predictions from AI company CEOs, who cluster around 2027-2030. Researchers surveyed show 50% confidence in AGI by 2040, but the accelerating trend suggests even this timeline may prove optimistic as capabilities continue surprising experts.","criteria_definition":"AI system matching or exceeding human-level cognitive abilities across broad range of tasks rather than single domain excellence","confidence_level":"Median prediction from 2,778 AI researchers across 8 peer-reviewed surveys, with increasing trend toward earlier estimates over time","source_name":"2,778 AI Researchers Survey","source_url":"https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/","concept_keys":["agi","accelerating-change","survey-drift"]}
