{"tldr_summary":"Manifold Markets, a play-money prediction platform tracking AGI arrival through adversarial Turing test capability, shows shockingly aggressive timelines from its 1,100+ participants. The market currently places 47% probability on AGI arriving before 2028—just two years away—with median prediction landing at 2032. The platform references both the Longbets wager between Ray Kurzweil and Mitch Kapor and Matthew Barnett's Metaculus criteria, requiring AI to convince human judges of its humanness through text-based dialogue where judges actively try to unmask imposters. Prediction markets theoretically aggregate diverse opinions more effectively than expert surveys by creating financial incentives for accuracy, though play-money markets lack real skin-in-the-game. The near-term odds represent either collective wisdom about rapid capability gains or groupthink optimism fueled by recent LLM breakthroughs. Either way, over 1,000 people are betting AGI is closer than most academic surveys suggest.","criteria_definition":"AI system capable of passing high-quality adversarial Turing test where human judges cannot reliably unmask AI as impostor despite good-faith attempts","confidence_level":"Market-based probability distribution with 1,100+ participants trading on likelihood, representing aggregated confidence through financial incentives","source_name":"Manifold Markets (~1100 contributors)","source_url":"https://manifold.markets/ManifoldAI/agi-when-resolves-to-the-year-in-wh-d5c5ad8e4708","concept_keys":["agi","turing-test","prediction-markets"]}
