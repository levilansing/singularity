{"tldr_summary":"Marco Trombetti, CEO of Rome-based translation company Translated, developed a novel singularity predictor: Time to Edit (TTE), measuring how long professional editors take fixing AI-generated translations versus human ones. His company tracked this metric across 2 billion post-editing events from 2014 to 2022, showing machines rapidly closing the gap. Trombetti argues language represents AI's hardest challenge—'the most natural thing for humans'—making translation parity a legitimate AGI proxy. His data-driven extrapolation points to end-of-decade singularity, somewhere between 2029-2030. The approach offers refreshing specificity compared to vague expert intuitions: rather than pontificating about consciousness or reasoning, Trombetti measures actual productivity convergence. If AI can translate as well as humans, the logic goes, it demonstrates the broad cognitive capabilities defining general intelligence. Whether translation truly captures AGI's essence remains debatable, but the quantitative methodology beats hand-waving about 'profound transformations.'","criteria_definition":"AI achieving human-level translation accuracy measured by Time to Edit metric, indicating broader artificial general intelligence through language mastery","confidence_level":"High confidence based on quantitative Time to Edit (TTE) metric tracking AI translation performance approaching human parity from 2014-2022, with clear trend line extrapolation","source_name":"Popular Mechanics December 2025","source_url":"https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/robots/a69820101/when-the-singularity-will-happen-trend-timeline/","concept_keys":["event-horizon"]}
