{"tldr_summary":"Masayoshi Son told SoftBank World attendees in October 2023 that the singularity would arrive within a decade, with AGI becoming '10 times more intelligent than all total human intelligence' by 2033. The Japanese billionaire explicitly acknowledged standing alone: 'Nobody but me believes AGI will be a reality in ten years. I am the first one that clings strongly to this belief.' Son compared those not embracing AI to 'unempowered goldfish' and warned the intelligence delta between AGI users and non-users would equal the gap between humans and monkeys. His conviction that artificial super intelligence (ASI) would follow within 20 years positions him as the most aggressive major investor on AGI timelines. This is the same Son who turned $20 million into $100 billion with his Alibaba bet, then lost most of it on WeWork and other failed tech investments. His track record combines visionary wins with spectacular failures—making his AGI prediction either prescient or another example of billionaire hubris unconstrained by expert consensus.","criteria_definition":"Artificial general intelligence 10 times more intelligent than total human intelligence, leading to singularity crossover point","confidence_level":"Very high confidence despite admitting 'Nobody but me believes AGI will be a reality in ten years.
