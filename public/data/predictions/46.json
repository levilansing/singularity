{"tldr_summary":"Louis Rosenberg—the engineer who built the first functional augmented reality system at Air Force Research Lab in the early 1990s—took a notably conservative stance on Singularity timing compared to his peers. His 2040-2060 range, centering on 2050, reflected a pragmatic view that genuine AGI requires breakthroughs we can't yet envision, so hedge toward later dates. Unlike Kurzweil's exponential confidence or Vinge's dramatic 'end of the human era' rhetoric, Rosenberg's forecast acknowledged that hardware improvements don't automatically translate to intelligence. His background in human-computer interfaces gave him firsthand experience with the gap between raw computing power and actual capability—you can have all the processing speed in the world, but if your algorithms are fundamentally limited, you're stuck. Rosenberg's prediction aged relatively well; his mid-century estimate looks more plausible now than the aggressive 2020s predictions many of his contemporaries made. His approach: assume multiple hard problems remain unsolved, add buffer time for unknown unknowns, and don't confuse impressive demos with general intelligence.","criteria_definition":"Computer intelligence surpassing and exceeding human intelligence across all domains with profound societal consequences.","confidence_level":"Moderate confidence with conservative estimate acknowledging unknown technological barriers","source_name":"Emerj survey of AI researchers","source_url":"https://emerj.com/when-will-we-reach-the-singularity-a-timeline-consensus-from-ai-researchers/","concept_keys":["event-horizon","accelerating-change"]}
