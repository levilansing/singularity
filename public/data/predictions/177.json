{"tldr_summary":"Forget AGI timelines—Yann LeCun says the real action is happening right now in robotics. Speaking at Davos, Meta's chief AI scientist declared that 2025 marks the beginning of the 'decade of robotics,' where AI advances finally converge with physical systems to create robots that can actually do useful things in the real world. This isn't about humanoid robots taking over; it's about AI systems that understand physical dynamics, can manipulate objects, navigate real environments, and complete long-horizon tasks without constant human intervention. LeCun's timing is strategic: his predicted 'world models' paradigm (2028-2030) will provide the cognitive architecture, but the robotics revolution starts now as companies race to build the hardware and integration layers. The prediction reflects growing consensus that embodied AI—systems that interact with physical reality—represents the next major frontier after language models. While ChatGPT impressed everyone with text generation, LeCun argues the transformative impact will come from AI that can fold laundry, navigate warehouses, assist in surgery, and handle physical tasks currently requiring human dexterity and judgment. If he's right, we're at the beginning of a decade that finally delivers on robotics promises made since the 1960s.","criteria_definition":"Decade of robotics beginning immediately, combining AI advances with robotics to enable intelligent physical applications in real-world environments","confidence_level":"Stated as present reality rather than prediction, with high confidence that robotics revolution is beginning now","source_name":"Meta AI chief statements January 2025","source_url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/metas-yann-lecun-predicts-a-new-ai-architectures-paradigm-within-5-years-and-decade-of-robotics/","concept_keys":["transformative-ai","scaling-hypothesis"]}
